we're volatile i can't call it though
it's like too large a peg and too small a hole yeah
but she cheats and i catch her like the common cold sneeze
last time i broke her collar bone she's intolerabl yeah
all i know is that the sex is phnomenal though
we're an unlikely pair yeah
like two different nike airs
but i'm the same size she wears jordans
so i think we're soulmates though yeah
people don't like us together but like we care not me not me
yeah but god strike me dead yeah
she knows that i would walk over hot coals
for her with both of my feet bare yeah
but soon as i ask to hit ask to hit
it's like she grabs a switch grabs a switch
and turns me over her knee
'cause my ass is whipped yeah
and i got her back but i'm spineless yeah
so when she stabs me in mine yeah
it's like i just can't feel the knife what
as she pokes jabs it and slices
one minute she'll build me up up
the next she'll push me 'round
probably why she calls me dumbbell
she lifts me up yeah then puts me down huh
but i am under her thumbnail
i must be under her spell
it's like lookin' right into a gun barrel
but none of these hoes can fuck with my girl
she got that
we wake up break up make up like maybelline
now she's all made up like makebelieve
probably why she's so fake to me
but what the fuck's it gonna take for me to make her see
strip her naked and take her keys
i been plannin' this day for weeks
but i can't tell if i'm 'wake or 'sleep
but if this is actually happenin' sucker for pain
i'm stuck in this radioactive pattern
but her by her motherfuckin' hair's
all i imagine draggin' dragon
she lunges attacks and scratches
but i ain't gonna stand for that shit
like kaep for the national anthem
as i stab i'm laughin'
so much for witchcraft and magic
abracadabra that bitch
no turnin' back i'm blackin'
as i say farewell to the love of my life i cut and i slice
i give her one last hug goodbye
wipe the blood off my butterfly knife
watch her fuckin' die right in front of my eyes
but in hindsight
think i just wanted to see what her insides look like
as i pop another five vic's
that's what this high's like
look down there's mud on my nikes
shovel at my side blood on my mic
now wake up to music to be murdered by like
before i check the mic check check one two
i give it a extra swipe with a lysol disinfectant wipe good evening
coronavirus in effect tonight
antiseptics on deck i got every type yeah
i throw on my tux then i yeah give zero fucks then i yeah
act like a jockstrap uh cup my nuts then i yeah
check my ball hair what make sure it's all there yeah
then call the pallbearer yeah
it's music to b murdered by again why stop
overkill lik a pipe bomb in your pine box
you're all hitched to my cock what
went from punchin' a time clock to getting my shot
then treated it like a cyclops
like it's the only one i only one eye got
and my thoughts are like nines cocked chkchk
every line's obscene pervertedest mind got the dirtiest rhyme stocked
that's why there's parental advising visine every time i drop eye drop
so throw on the theme to alfred i'll channel him like the panama canal
but how could i get up in arms about you saying trash is all that i put out
bitch i still get the bag when i'm putting garbage out
plus the potty mouth i'm not about to wash it out
the filthiest so all this talk about i'm washed up how preposterous
because if cleanliness is next to godliness
it's obvious that it's impossible for me to be beside myself
and i'm 'bout that capital like a proper noun
still on top the pile
got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial
quick to call you out on your bullshit
don't make me give that crock a dial
'cause if i do it see you later alligator
made it out the trailer then i made a vow to cater to no one
so hate i've gained about the same amount that's in my bank account
so here's some more shit for you to complain about i say the
bars that never slack yeah but always get attacked yeah
i think they're gunnin' for me it's startin' to feel like that
like i'm marked 'cause when i rap it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit
'cause i have this target on my back ew yuck
but if i ever doublecrossed my fans and lost my stans
i'd probably pop five xans yeah
go in my garage start my van
inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust i can
and doze off like snores
but odds like that with these thoughts i have's like a giant getting squashed by ants
if this is the test of time i'd pass with flying colors
like i just tossed my crayons tossed my crayons
small medium and large size cans
sanitizers of all types brands cost nine bands
which is a small price for lysol wipes and
if my palms brush across my pants i wash my hands
i sit in silence in candlelit environments
sipping wild irish while getting violent
homicidal visions when i'm spitting like this
but really i'm just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes
which is really childish and silly but i'm really like this
i'm giving nightmares to billie eilish i'm diddy's side bitch
so 'til the end since epmd
been givin' y'all the business yeah dre and me yup
from the mmlp to mtbmb bitch
bitch it's 2020 you still ain't seein' me haha
so call me santa claus santa claus
'cause at the present yeah i outrap 'em all wrap 'em all i'm at the mall
got your bitch in a bathroom stall she could suck a basketball uh
through a plastic straw yeah with a fractured jaw damn
my dick is coat check ha she wanna jack it off yeah
i'm so far past the bar i should practice law
mentally i'm fucked up generally general lee duh
dukes of hazzard car yeah get the cadaver dogs
'cause this is murder murder and you'll get murked murked
this music 'bout to kill you brr brr brr
this chicken hit my phone she said chirp chirp
i said hut hut hike your skirt skirt
then go eat some worms like the early bird
what the fuck is love that's a dirty word
make me fall in it there's not a girl on earth
or any other planet that's a world of hurt
and i won't buy a designer 'cause i don't pander panda
but i'm back with so many knots i need a chiropractor damn
and this the final chapter why 'cause i'm either frying after oh
or they gon' give me the needle what like a vinyl scratcher dj
yeah i'm a card like hallmark
at walmart with a small cart buying wall art
and y'all who claim to be dogs aren't
no bite like a tree mostly just all bark arf arf
but y'all pickin' the wrong tree they call me dog because i'm barking bar king bark bark barking
and i got a lot yeah like where cars park
i'd describe it as bowling why ball hard ball's hard
'cause the gutter's where my mind is and when
it's in this frame better split like the five and the ten
'cause without a second to spare i'm strikin' again
and when the beat is up my alley i go right for the pens pins
the cypher begins
i'm talkin' smack like heroin the mic's a syringe
it's like a binge vicodin i would liken to tin
my mind is a recycling bin
there's no place i never been
but i never budge and i never bend
you hyperextend on me this game's life it depends
like adult diapers for men
even when i'm rappin' less stellar
it's sour grapes i still whine i'm the best seller cellar
like a trey deuce spray you as these shots penetrate through dre's booth
and go straight through your grapefruit no escape route
so you won't leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds
your ass is grass and i am not gonna graze you
but if bars were semimac's i'd be the mad hatter
'cause i got so many caps and you don't have any straps nah
so you'd be a fitted yeah so don't act like you fittin' to snap
bitch i'll pee p on your head like a phillies hat haha
no stoppin' me you're on a window shopping spree
bitch you probably go broke at the dollar tree
you never buy shit all you ever cop's a plea
you're always punkin' out like halloween
you rather opt to flee you need to stop it punk
homie you're not a g act like you got the pump
and you're gonna cock the heat or get the glock and dump
bitch if you shot a tree you wouldn't pop the trunk
yeah and i'm buddies with alfred we about to
disembowel them gut 'em and scalp 'em yeah
this is 'bout to be the bloodiest outcome
'cause we gon' make you bleed with every cut from this album
so i'm choppin' 'em up like dahmer
the nut job with the nuts that are bigger than jabba the hutt
i'm in the cut and i'm out for the blood
it's lookin' like it's that time of the month
carvin' 'em up with the bars while i sharpen 'em up dog and a mutt
i'm gonna fuck your mom in the butt with a thermometer fuckin' phenomenal but
y'all'll get cut the fuck up like abdominals if you don't vmonos
i keep droppin' like dominos the formidable abominable
stompin' a mudhole in my comp even if it's off the top of the dome
son 'em get the coppertone i'm at the stop and go coppin' the mop and glo
got your stomach in knots like you swallowed rope

it's my alter ego's fault
these evil thoughts could be so dark

'cause you're watchin' your heart race like you're scarface
in a car chase with the cops or an arcade
stuck inside of a mario kart race duckin' saw blades
at a stop and a start pace
what i'm tryin' to say is i'm drivin' 'em all crazy
i see the rap game then attack the verses uh
turn into a graveyard packed with hearses yeah
just like your funeral i'm at your service what
pockets 'on stuff' like a taxidermist woo
just landed in los angeles when this chick angela and her grandmother in a tan
colored van pull up with a handful of xans
and a substantial amount of gan' just to ask what my

yeah now you gotta get killed but it's not a big deal but every thought is so ill
and so methodical thought i swallowed a pill
i'm starting to feel like i'm an automobile
with barnacle bill inside the car at the wheel
inside a carnival 'cause i'm plowin' into everyone who wrote snidey articles
and that explains why the fuck you clowns are all in my grill
joy and pain fortune fame torture shame choice i made
swore someday the world would pay less to lose more to gain daughters raised
yesterday glory days adored and praised ignored the hate
addressed the fake toured with dre tore a page from jordan came
destroyed the game before you came enjoy your stay
before it's gone away but the more you claim that you're gonna point and aim
if it joined a gang your shit isn't going to bang
you're just boring lame and more of the same
you have an enormous chain but a stormless brain
the most you can form is rain
your shit is pointless same as a scoreless game
so bitch quit lyin' you're denyin' like mr porter's name haha
borderline bipolar disorder since my stroller
eyes rollin' back in my skull like eli porter
fire mortar brr rounds ayatollah every iota i load up
i owe to my motor mouth
this is my note to self
sometimes you're gonna bomb
so you just might have to blow yourself up with no one's help
i just wrote it down in my book of rhymes
preemo take us out
yeah i was young i was hungry
i was chasin' the bag at twentyone i was lucky
to find an unaten fucking what honeybun i forgot about
now i got money fallin' out fiftis hundreds and twenties twenties
and i know nothing is funny 'bout the manchester bombing
but we got something in common what both of us are alarming
foul disgusting and awful yeah so repugnant and ugly yup
i could give the boston marathon a run for its money yeah
and you could say i'm a little bit immature
but this type of literature got me a little richer
but i get insecure when them other dudes hit on you girl
you're letting 'em fiddle with your clitoris
remember you were my fucking
always hated my smile
mama told me it's goofy
i'd get picked on at school
come home and she'd school me
she never sugarcoated it to me
she said if i wasn't so stupid and ugly i wouldn't always get bullied true
i think of my struggles yeah and get emotional
could be 'cause how behind the eightball and far in the hole that they put me
now i'm on a roll like a tootsie yeah
i'm just trollin' you pussies
but i'm like a stroller 'cause you'll see just how i roll if you push me
but that's what i do this music for
when i was goin' through some of the hardest times i drew from her
but she's like the devil 'cause i just can't let loose of her lucifer
'cause the thought of losin' her makes me wanna just let loose on her
then i hit the studio tryna rendezvous with her
tell her it's a buttdial girl yeah booty call haha
that's how it used to be 'cause you and me we ruled the world
and we made curtis blow kurtis blow 50
fuck i miss them days
would you marry me again
now that everything has changed yeah
it'll never be the same nah
as the era whence we came who
from nas to pac ra yeah eric b and kane i know
but i know a few from this era that are lyrically insane
and although most are never gonna hit the level cole or weezy at
or be emotionally attached to yo mtv raps yeah
runnin' home from school to catch an episode the feeling that
it gave you to rip the plastic off the tape you're holdin'
peel it back yeah tear it off and play it what
and swear to god four o'clock
we'd crowd around the tv butter in his underwear and socks
when naunie was kon artis yeah and proof had his hair in locs doody
yeah back when flavor flav had us wearin' clocks
back with back with ed lover yeah
and there was two dr dre's that's a paradox pair of docs
but i never thought i'd get so jealous
at the thought of letting you go psychologically
it's gonna bother me my eyes are already watery
part of me don't wanna stop yeah 'til i get you back
if i gotta put the work in and tell you i'm never givin' this up
other part wants to tell you just to get fucked
go back to whatever dick that you sucked ah
get back together with them you slut
givin' up the vagina like a trip to the gynecologist
when i helped you become bigger than you were
but i guess that it slipped your mind you must be biding your time
looking for someone to come along that'll make you feel like i did back when you were mine huh damn
but truthfully it was never really you and me exclusively
and there's too many new mc's you can choose between
but no matter how many motherfuckers ran through it they can't do it like me
but i can't keep burnin' the candle at both ends
and i can't handle it when i leave and you find another one
now i gotta take this beat and dismantle it
i won't grieve when i kill you
but if i can't have you bitch nobody can
can't believe i used to be your favorite bitch

i mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill violence but with skill
that's why i hence when i write ends up with the mic and pencil gettin' killed haha yeah hold up
and i'm still ride or die for the squad yeah
so you know which side that i'm on
if a battle line's ever drawn but if i get involved
it'll be like k9's in a brawl
but not similar to mike vick at all
'cause even if i don't have a dog in the fight
they ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog fight in the dog
got stripes like a tiger so you might get mauled a mic in the palms
like claws i can swing right for your jaw
and rip it off with one swipe of the paw
bitch you still on my dick or nah nah
if i suck your wife is a straw straw
i'm sick and i'm not gonna cover my mouth next time that i cough 'cause
and da got that dope he sends to me uhhuh
it's like pneumonia symptoms and contracting covid instantly
which is what separates my flow from theirs
so that no one gets even close to this to pose a risk to me
so vocalistically what that's social distancing yeah
flow going viral you best stay strapped
with that lysol and get way back shh
get that pinesol and that ajax
'cause this dry cough is just like football umpires callin' a playback
bitch back the fuck up like fifteen yards these rhymes call for a face mask face mask
'nother fourteenday quarantine they're cordoning off everything
this shit lookin' like a horror scene like me metaphorically damn
'cause them stayathome orders seem
like they just keep getting more extreme
who knows when this nightmare will end marilyn like monroe norma jean norma jean
still got that heroin lyrical drip with that morphine and that thorazine
'cause i'm so fuckin' dope dope and you're a fiend
and that's the one thing that hasn't changed nope
for some semblance of normalcy
but i might need that hydrochloroquine 'cause i got that yeah
the dark horse i'm a knightmare
mom fed me valium like air mmm
thought that's why they called it a high chair woah
i got a contact like eyewear woah
wait a minute bitch let me lie here uh
2020 hindsight in my side mirror
every year you drop the ball like times square
my hair trigger whenever i get an idea's
like fuck now my name rings out like a sponge mop
and my drip was a drop
in the bucket so that gun shot
you just heard just now in that one spot
just came from the nine mil' that i just got
that's big bucks and i got a full money clip and i'm loaded
i ain't even mean to go the fuck off
and i'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate
groping it while i'm holding it like a trophy
i'm hoping a little codeine'll get me od'in'
woah everything is slow i begin to floating
i know that i'm getting loaded the pen exploded
hiroshima with the flows a utopia
with the dope i'm an og i'm like the goat
here to get your goat little bit of sodium it's assault a salt
when i'm at the podium at your throat holy camoly
i'm in the zone with the shit i'm on
get imodium and a commode because nobody's even close
you're petroleum to plutonium you're a phony
i'm at the crib with your ho
got her at the pole like voting with no clothing
stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating
i've got my nose in the air like a boeing
then i got into a little bit of an argument with her
so i took a little lick of a klonopin at dinner
then i hit her with the motherfucking ottoman and bit her
then i shot her in the liver delivered her to the bottom of the river dope
but i'm probably gon' jump in the water with her
with a wad of money 'cause i got a lot of it
and when it come to drippin' i be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour
never runnin' out of either one of 'em i gotta get it 'cause
i look at me now i'm thinkin damn
how proud of me i am
what i did is nothin' to sneeze at
even if your allergies are bad
i'm up in a balcony in france
i look around i see the fans
how they surround me in the stands
probably could drown in a sea of hands
they're hollerin' shady shady
yelling it out to me and that's what i mean when i say
that one day someway somehow if i get the chance to get a crowd
i'd flip it around and have a crowd give me the chants
i've done it all man
but in actuality i haven't yet
got no time for no haters in this bitch
or toleration for this shit
but like medication my dedication
and the time it takes to do this shit
reminds me of how an overcrowded hospital waiting room'll get
what i mean is maybe i have more patience patients than i'm able to admit
yeah but i'm still mentally stable as a threelegged table in this bitch
fame was a switch but i was grateful to trade this shit for the trailer with a hitch
that it would make me a raving lunatic
but i made it through my situation i hit pay dirt
now i get paper like a stapler in this bitch
but just 'cause i made a little bit of change
don't mean i've changed a little bit
brain full of wit dangerous can't extinguish this english language when it's lit
and i'm just berating you with it it's shady 'til i'm eightytwo
i'll spit this crazy even dre he knows nose i'ma blow

if it hadn't been for the pad and the pen
addict mom and deadbeat dad
i wouldn't have had the savage within
havin' to win every single battle i'm in
all i ever wanted was to be an emcee
tediously i wrote obediently believing in me

black people saved my life from the doc and deshaun
and all that we want is racial equality
rip laquan mcdonald trayvon and breonna
atatiana rayshard and dominique
eric garner and rodney king

before i lose my mind who am i gonna use it on
utilizing this tool i will execute a line
like what i tried to do one time in my youth when i euthanized
my poodle in junior high used to hide in my room and fly
to the moon and try suicide with the glue from my school supplies
then proof denaun
eyekyu and i would climb in that hooptie to ride to drew's and rhyme
bodied saint andrews hall too many times to count
before i tear up the shelter give my dawgs a pound
now i'm 'bout to treat all of you rappers noggins how
dre does every time he goes back to compton now
'cause every so often i'll visit my old stomping grounds
and doc's in the house so you know the bong is out
room is spinning like ninehundredthousand miles an hour
forgot what i'm talkin' 'bout fuck i'm discombobulated
just flew the coop the cops are in hot pursuit
but the day they catch me is the day 50'll call a truce
and quash the feud with him and ja and ja'll actually spit a bar
that's not from a dr seuss book and they'll start a group haha
fuck it i'm a kook i know i got a screw

long as i got these walls and these hallways i'm always
have someone to argue with i'm just all twisted i'm discombobulated man
i'm at my best when i'm at my worst
and for that i'm blessed so every time i rap i curse
and that's why press i usually get attacked by first
they're at my neck like motherfucking vampires
so critics siday i siday the same shidit i'm always degrading little biditch
well fiduck 'em they can siduck my didick when i'm taking a shidit
midy middle fidinger is extidended now should i tell 'em where to put it

so i act like i'm on a kayak with my back to niagara
no life jacket man i had like six psychiatrists scientists
misdiagnose me with plaque psoriasis 'cause i asked 'em why is it
my eye itches so they gave me some diet tips
and viagra with side effects i might end up growing spiderwebs
in my head and dying a horrifying death on my final breath
i will tell you apply your lips to my dick it's one size that fits
i just took an aids test and the doctor said to think positive what the fuck
they said my last album i sounded bitter

who ninety percent of
these hypocrites are tryna get rid of
but why would i get a chip on my shoulder
i was considered one time as the illest
bitch i'm still as fly as your zipper

nobody said shit about 2 chainz as long as he's been here shit
no wonder you're mad now i'm
looking at them plaques count 'em yeah

i sell like four mil' when i put out a bad album what
revival flopped came back and i scared the crap out 'em
but rolling stone stars i get two and a half outta
five and i'll laugh out loud
'cause that's what they gave bad back in the day
which actually made me not feel as bad now 'cause
if it happened to james
it can happen to shady
they do the same shit to brady
more people hate me than love me
this game will make you go crazy
'bout to go for broke
i was the g the oat
once i was played in rotation

i lose the rage i'm too tame
i get it back they say i'm too angry
i need to get me some dre beats

'bout to pick up some weights and lift 'til my tattoo of hailie's face stretches
they said i'm just a whiner i sound like a baby
i dish it out but can't take it
but i take it dish it back out
and they get all bent out of shape
this shit's almost comical
wait and i meant no disrespect
i wasn't dissin' tech that was not a shot at 2 chainz or to jayz
they probably feel the same way because lately
instead of us being credited for longevity
and being able to keep it up for this long at this level we
get told we'll never be what we were
bitch if i was as half as good as i was
i'm still twice as good as you'll ever be
only way that you're ahead of me's alphabetically
'cause if you diss me i'm coming after you like the letter v

please dawg i need y'all to keep talking shit 'cause i feed off of it
i am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak bars i'ma leave carnage
each thought'll be so toxic it'll block the wind through your esophagus
stop it cutting off your oxygen
and i hit them pads like a boxing gym
better watch for slim better get to popping and when i'm at the top again
i won't topple i'm giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and i'm not gonna stop
but when they ask me is the war finished with mgk of course it is
i cleansed him of his mortal sins i'm god and the lord forgives even the devil worshippers
i'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone when you're born with lucifer's horns
and you're from the school of notorious puba cube and the poor righteous teachers tutored my students
showed them all the blueprint and formula
but it seems like the more they studied my music the more they remind me of eyeballs
i'm watching my pupils get cornier uh
but i'm contemplating yelling bombs away on the game
like i'm outside of an ariana grande concert waiting
man i don't see why they hate me huh
i'm a clown like john wayne gacy what
they call me kanye crazy yah
apeshit beyonce jayz woo
and i'm back with andre baby yeah

run up in a church like pew pew pew
'cause that's what i do do do
but even to the untrained human eye
we ain't the same you and i
somebody should have explained to you why
for you to go against me it's simply insane you will die yeah
that's why they call me kamikaze it's plain suicide yeah
but i know magic and here go my last trick
i'm 'bout to say abracadabra and pull a b rabbit up out of my hat
i'm about to relapse and i betcha that you won't know how to react
but a look of disgust i don't doubt it'd be that
as i begin to fuckin' devour the track
and you backpedal that is a cowardly act
like a saudi attack when the towers collapsed
i'm a product of properly hoppin' up out of that poverty
profitin' all for coppin' and swappin' that property out for a possible monopoly
try not to adopt my father's old philosophies
same time i'm prayin' to god that everything works out at his colonoscopy
i'm walkin' across a suicidal tightrope intentionally
while the demons comin' out of me
wifey's on the side of me talkin' sense into me
without she i feel incomplete mentally she's been sent to me
right there since '96 worse nightmare to side chicks some things are just meant to be
this it for me give my daughters a kiss for me
y'all call this fame i call this shit alcoholistic infamy
targettin' my kids and babies through population and gun control
shit make me wanna make a hunnid more
make a bigot racist uncomfortable
if y'all against talk and reparation then i'm not against the thought of separation
while the politicians that are white and privileged ask how is this different from segregation that's funny bro
segregation is bein' told where i'm gonna go
separation is bein' woke and goin' wherever i wanna go
never sold dope for no gold rope

making you feel like you got bent over and raped
little boy you're never gonna get no rope chain

that they can't even figure out where their words
should hit the kick and the snare

this could never work is what we said at first
but whatever this is it's working
butwe'rein two differentworlds and yeah
i'm not your husbandnah you ain't my girlfriend
all i know is that what
when i'm with you i'm a different person yeah
and i ain't never met a chick as perfect
girl you're a ten so here i am yeah

thinking 'bout you
she's asleep you're texting me around two
crying face emoji you say this is me without you
we're sneaking out to meet at cheap hotel rooms or
sex in the car then i'll text you tomorrow
do i question it nah no objection at all
'cause both of us are still involved so
as i'm peelin' off all i'm thinking 'bout is
you're laying there with him thinking 'bout me
he's asleep you say let's meet around three
you went to leave the house he caught you sneaking out now he's freaking out
you thought he was sleepin' soundly woah
you say you're going for a drive you don't question him
when he stumbles in like where the fuck you've been
then you pump his ear with what he wants to hear
tell him you love him yeah wipe each other's tears
but it's been a couple years since we been doin' dirt
you or my girl don't wanna see either of you get hurt
but now the lines are getting super blurred
can't tell if i'm cheating on her with you or cheating on you with her
but really nobody's at fault can't help who you love
hope they don't overhear us talk
'cause we both are getting sloppy
probably subconsciously part of me's hoping we get caught 'cause
we're laying here with them thinking 'bout us
'cause now when we get home we get jealous
of each other being someone else's
call us long john silver's 'cause we selfish
but i just wanna see ya
don't care if it's at the ritz or motel 6
if i'm there with ya rich or poor
when i'm laying here with ya it could be the kitchen floor
i could stay in bed with ya starin' at ya 'til the morn'
i just wanna be your secret lover yeah
i'd rather share ya than to not have you at all
so once a year or twice a month i'm here if you want it
yeah i'm open season

'cause i make bands and i call getting cheese a cakewalk cheesecake yeah
bitch i'm a player i'm too motherfuckin' stingy for cher

cristhian rivera 'cause my lyrics never sit well
so they wanna give me the chair
like a paraplegic and it's scary call it hari kari
'cause e'ry tom and dick and harry carry a merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
swearing up and down they can spit this shit's hilarious
it's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
we wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem

trigger happy pack heat but it's black ink
evil half of the bad meets
evil that means take a back seat

you're bringin' the killer within me outta me
you don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
and be on the receivin' end of me what stupidity it'd be
every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter

i'm on the toilet bowl i got a trailer full of money and i'm paid in full
i'm not afraid to pull a
here i am alone again
can't get out of this hole i'm in
it's like the walls are closin' in
you can't help me no one can
i can feel these curtains closin'
i go to open 'em
but something pulls 'em closed again
hello darkness my old friend
feels like i'm loathing in las vegas
haven't got the vaguest why i'm so lost
but i'd make you this small wager
if i bet you i'll be in tomorrow's paper
who would the odds favor
hello darkness my old friend
i'm so much like my father you would think that i knew him
i keep pacin' this room valium then chase it with booze
one little taste it'll do
maybe i'll take it and snooze then tear up the stage in a few
hello darkness my old friend
fuck the colt 45 i'ma need somethin' stronger
if i pop any caps it better be off of vodka
round after round after round i'm gettin' loaded haha
that's a lot of shots huh double entendre
hello darkness my old friend
now i'm starin' at the room service menu off a benzo
i can hear the music continue to crescendo
i can see the whole fuckin' venue from my window
that's when you know you're schizo hello darkness my old friend
'cause i keep peekin' out the curtain from the hotel
the music is so loud
but it's almost as though i don't hear no sound
i should get ready for the show now
wait is this the whole crowd i thought this shit was sold out
hello darkness my old friend
but it's only the opening act it's early don't overreact
then something told me relax
and just hope for the show to be packed
don't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max
'cause that'd be totally wack
you can't murder a show nobody's at hello darkness my old friend
but what if nobody shows panic mode
'bout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second
'bout to cancel the show just as fans below rush the entrance
plan is a go to wreck shit cameras in all directions hello darkness my old friend
the press is 'bout to go ape shit bananas on all the networks
commando with extra clips i got ammo for all the hecklers
i'm armed to the teeth another valium fall off the bed
hit the ground and crawl to the dresser
alcohol on my breath as i reach for the scope
i'm blackin' out i'm all out of meds
with them benzodiazepines gone
now it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor
fuck the media i'm goin' all out this is war
hello darkness my old friend
people start to show up time to start the show up
it's 1005 pm and the curtain starts to go up
and i'm already sweatin' but i'm locked and loaded
for rapid fire spittin' for all the concertgoers
scopes for sniper vision surprise from out of nowhere
as i slide the clip in from inside the hotel
leanin' out the window going keyser sze
finger on the trigger but i'm a licensed owner
with no prior convictions so law says sky's the limit
so my supply's infinite strapped like i'm a soldier
got 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences
some of them john travolta staying alive by inches
hello darkness my old friend
cops are knockin' oh fuck thought i blocked the entrance
guess show time is over
no suicide note just a note for target distance
but if you'd like to know the reason why i did this
you'll never find a motive truth is i have no idea
i am just as stumped no signs of mental illness
just tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked
'cause by the time it's over won't make the slightest difference
hello darkness my old friend
five dozen fliesbuzzin' over your head
call me the grim reaper sleep is my cousin
you're dead to me now and i'ma be the last face you see
'fore you die cussin' yep
my eye a tiger's and i'm a survivor so i will rise up and what
be triumphant 'cause when i'm looking at my legacy leg i see
bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
like triumph the puppet so i'm like fuck it
pile the carnage up 'til it's so high it's touching the sky
let 'em all line up and attack
single filing up in the stack
call 'em toy soldiers yeah
'cause they just wind up on their backs
now the sky's nothing but black
but i am not coming back i done told ya
i told the woke me to go to sleep
but still they keep on provoking me
they're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
but how in the fuck am i not supposed to be woke
when these fuckers just keep poking me now
i've been down kicked
like around six thousand times since i was a kid
as a child picked on clowned been
countless times i've been doubted
gotta remind myself of it every now and then yeah
so the route i went's selfempowerment
in a hole taught myself how to get out of it
and balance it with talents wit
'cause life is like a penny life is like a penny
'cause it's only one percent
who overcome the shit they've underwent
i went awol like what my back was up against
don't tell me 'bout struggle bitch i lived it
i was five or six the first time i got my hind end kicked
malcolm isaac and boogie jumped me and took my tricycle
and i don't know if i would call that white privilege yeah
but i get it how it feels to be judged by pigment
besides getting it from both sides of the tracks
but i swore i'd get them back
even if it meant selling my soul to get my revenge and what
thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking
if i can believe in myself i could prolly achieve it
that's part of the reason i do all my talking with ink
and as long as i'm breathing i vow to outsmart 'em and beat 'em
my god what a heart of a demon go at 'em and i'ma get even
like i'm in the garden of eden i'm 'bout to go off of the deep end
this evil is calling i'm already seething and
okay so while macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat yeah
i was getting my ass beat twice a week what
looking for a place for the night where i could sleep yeah
flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see
if i could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat
if denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece
twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips
we'd be glad to get that even if we had to split
we'd do backward flips looking back at it
i think that would fit with the definition of not having shit
couple that with the fact my mother was batshit
pop was a sack of shit yeah he died but i gave half a shit
yeah which brings me back to the dear ol' dad that i zero had
since a yearold fortyseven yearold scab
just to hear them words ear piercing
like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring
should i feel upset you were dead to me 'fore you died
me tear no shed
should i have made a mural at your funeral
had your coffin draped with a hero's flag
where the fuck you were at
when de'angelo done hurt me real bad at the rio grande
never met your grandkids fucking coward
only guts you had was from your stomach fat
i couldn't see your ass goin' to heaven
so i'm asking for a pass to go to hell
so i can whip your fucking ass
i hate that i'll never get to say i hate you to your face
no coming back from where i'm going
sky is dark my soul is black hand on the shovel
dig with the blade of it then i step on the metal
vendetta to settle tell the devil
bumstickitty bumstickitty bum huh

popo in the way i'll roll over 'em and make bacon
and call 'em a pig won't you hop up off of my dick
words in the way i'm at loss by him
i give you a jfk on the front lawn of mlk in the crossfire get down nigga
i have evolved into the lost diaries of the mob and the rothschilds c'mon
i feel like god broke the vials and i am just layin' down inside 'em like caulk and tile qtip
yo snappin' necks plus i'm live in effect
i'm in the slick rick eye patch but i got it from hex
rappers avoid eye contact that's outta respect
for the god in the flesh the ominous indominus rex
they be like you put the thought on yikes
if i told y'all once i told y'all twice that motherfucker is nice
i'm the king of the blood sport on mics
i'm from an era you had beef y'all prolly fist fought on sight
get your ass beat at the basketball court on spite
then tell your wife to put your life support on ice
i'm the rap pernell whitaker the honorable minister
leavin' every amateur inoperable i finished 'em
makin' plaques outta they head like dead venison
used to be the bad lieutenant with millitant
spillin' over fabulous jams my man dilla sent

and they cheated they lie like amerigo vespucci

live from the terrordome loud like a megaphone
thutmose the third with seven inch herringbones
better hope an ambulance is en route
papers are hand grenades soon as i pull the pin out
i am the santa fe mandalay and orlando and colorado and columbine
all combined into one i don't walk a line bitch i run
'cause we don't got no time to waste so come on denaun
here come me 5to9 and thought dadun dadun
then like a shotgun i'm ready to cock it on 'em

never had no trouble keepin' up with the times
i just adapt to the climate i treat it like my levi's
when they ain't buttoned up right i adjust on the fly
middle fingers put 'em high that's why they call it a bird
'cause you put it up in the sky
and i'm like a spider crawlin' up your spinal column
i'm climbin' all up the sides of the asylum wall
and dive in a pile of tylenol you're like a vagina problem
to a diabolical gynecologist tryna ball a fist i will
fuck you just buy me double timing the rhyming
i leave you stymied that's why they still vilify me like bill o'reilly
i'ma show you what i mean when they call me the harvey weinstein of 2019

yz and chiali rakim and eric b they were like my therapy
from big and paris three times dope and some we'll never see and prt
nwa and eazye and dre was like my gps
without him i don't know where i'd be
one thing thatsticks in my craw
when i wassix and i saw my stepfather hittin' my ma
socked her right in her eyeball
i'm startin' to think i'm psychotic
with all the pictures i draw of
shit that i've already witnessed its probably twisted my thoughts
all i can hear is drama with mom and him
i can always hear 'em arguin' down the hallways
the walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
our dog pissed on the carpet he stomped it so hard
doctors had to put it down
he killed my chihuahua this motherfucker
outside i look like i'm calm
inside i'm a tickin' time bomb
'cause of this motherfucker who sticks his dick in my mom my mom
last night he said i left the kitchen light on
but he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it i saw him
hickory switch to my bottom i counted sixtynine times
he swatted me with it i'd cry
he just started hittin' me harder
god i wish i could just jaw him
if i could get my weight up
but i'm just a second grader
this prick is bigger than i am
but i've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
i'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time
sneak up with a lethal injection
and put him down like they did to my dog
i'm talkin' euthanasia euthanasia like kids in taiwan
this fuckin' shit's like saigon saigon
neighbors called police on him
so many battery charges this dude's like lithiumion
then mom and him let bygones bygones
just be bygones
so on eggshells i walk and just try not to piss this guy off
but this is why i
so this year i'm goin' into the fifth and i'm tall
i'm five foot six on my block i'm the toughest kid but i got
way bigger fish to fry
which is why i'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off
the handle and wait for the fist to fly to put this guy in a pine box
he's always lookin' for chaos but tonight i've cooked up a plan
so this christmas i got some color books and some crayons
i'm layin' on the floor in the living room with some friends colorin'
he walks by kicks my arm and goes oops and just laughs
i yelled for mom mom and as she's rushin' to my defense
i stood up and said fuck you punk and i took off and ran
to my bedroom as i fled
knowin' shit would hit the fan
slammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat
he kicked it in
i swung it hard as i could at his head
his noodle went splat he fell right at the foot of my bed
i'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear
i threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass
beat him with my bare hands the big bad wolf ain't so bad
dingdong the pussy is dead the bully finally gets his
stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a twoliter with
then buried him next to my dog
and if i go to juvie for this i'ma tell 'em
checked in at the royal garden
to chill and avoid my problems
until paranoia caused me
to feel like i'm going bonkers
for real think my toilet's talkin'
i spilled like like forty bottles
of pills think your boy is startin'
to feel like a spoiled carton of milk
'cause it just occurred
my girl's cheatin' i'm kickin' that fucking bitch to the curb
but the word fucking ain't meant to be a descriptive word
the type of bitch she is ain't no adjective it's a verb
ho thinks her snatch is magical
but that's how she attracts men though
traps 'em and attack similar to an actual arachnid
or a vaginal tarantula or black widow
in fact it'll be nothin' to throw that lil' bitch with a capital b out the back window
of the black cadillac limo like a whack demo
when i'm strapped when i spit rapid like a ratchet
a halfwit i'll aim at then i'll
been fire bitch i can outrap reynolds
a pad and pen'll be great but a napkin'll do
return of the whack sicko
head spinnin' like invisibl skratch piklz

my mother thought i was such a fun little boy
oh what a bundle of joy
until the morning she suffered a punch in the groin
from a tantrum i was throwing
like a motherfuckin' disgruntled employee
i don't cut the beat 'til i fuckin' destroy it
once i get going rain thunder it's storming
puddles are forming i hear somebody's voice
in my head say it's still a dream

used to get jumped for my prowings
when i was growing up they said a slinky's a wonderful toy
my mother thought i was such a fun little boy
oh what a bundle of joy
until the morning she suffered a punch in the groin
from a tantrum i was throwing
like a motherfuckin' disgruntled employee
i don't cut the beat 'til i fuckin' destroy it
once i get going rain thunder it's storming
puddles are forming i hear somebody's voice
in my head say it's still a dream
then he said kill emcees
trippie redd with pills and lean
sipping meds in the limousine
getting head guillotine
yeah
so all of y'all can just suck a penis suck a penis
i'll do the opposite i'll do the opposite
eat you pussies like cunnilingus like cunnilingus
there ain't no stoppin' it there ain't no stoppin' it
they say i'm such a genius they say i'm such a genius
when that kamikaze hit when that kamikaze hit

treat you like a stepparent does to a stepchild with red hair and
plus i get dough like ed sheeran so call me the ginger bread man
i'm a stan of redman xclan and i'm a treach fan
but i look up to myself yeah

so why wwwwhy else would i call myself an alien
how could i hit a dry spell yeah i'm named after the wetlands
i could be with anybody i choose you
still it's no excuse to abuse you
but nooneknows what i'mgoin' through so i'd use you
tobe truthful i wouldn't know what to do if i lose you
so i refuse to might have a screw loose and a fuse blew
but i think i might be buildin' up a tolerance to you
'cause one minute i'm hollerin' screw you
next i take it back guess you can say i'm tryna unscrew you
but the shit's about to pop off yeah i feel you up
then i got you totally open as soon as i take your top off
you're so hard to resist you knock my socks off
my friends say you're bad for me hogwash
some days it feels like you're all that i have
that's why i'm tryna hold onto you for as long as i can
and you just want me for my money so i got you wrapped all in saran
damn talk about eatin' out the palm of my hand
but if not for my financials
i wouldn't have you anyways there have been ample
plenty days where i'm just in a daze and i can't pull
myself up out this rut and you're so much of a handful
i can only take so much of you all at one time
because too much of you's just too much to swallow sometimes
gotta take you in doses but when you're not at my side
i shake in convulsions separation anxiety 'cause we may be the closest
yeah baby we hopeless don't we make an atrocious
combination we know it's like playin' with explosives
quite dangerous though but my brain's in hypnosis
such a wide range of emotions
migraines but why the fuck am i takin' these motrins
ibuprofens like a drop of rain in the ocean
and you're my fix on the days when i'm broken
but the shit's about to go sideways i just know it
so i spiral downwardly 'cause i'm too cowardly to leave you
head is clouded in a fallacy but in reality
somehow it seems like when i lay me down to sleep i'm counting sheep
you're bound to creep
'cause every time i turn around you keep runnin' out on me
you're my xanax and my valium i'm an addict you're a downer
you're my habit it's like i found you in the cabinet
but it's like i can't uncap it 'cause it's childproof
a scoundrel and fiend's how i feel around you
awful every time i lost you felt like i had you in my pocket
now i'm flippin' over the furniture punchin' holes in the walls through
everything that we've gone through
how many times you've fucked me
but the way it felt for me to be on top when i was on you
swore my fealty but word to god
i thought you loved me bitch you tried to kill me i'm getting off you
quit callin' for me hard proof's how i respond to
the ambien and tylenols too
fuck all you

they talk about my daughters hopin' i fly off of the handle handle
'cause my first thought is to trample and write a thousand bars

or godzilla squashin' a crouton with combat boots on
or droppin' a goddamn nuke bomb on top of an anthill
i'm screamin' out no regrets can't do it nah
i'm a long way away from where you are in skill
foreign wheels my bitch wearin' fourinch heels
she on the orange pill
and she about to start taking off layers like orange peels
sacha baron cohen ferrell where am i going with this
oh yeah i bar at will
and when you throw the iron in it i'm all that still
the truth for real i'm real true call that trill
this is my house this place is mine
posted on any corner on any coast i'm on
you niggas need to leave that lean henny and coke alone
terror to the business married to the strippers tpain
student of the game prekane you niggas post malone
elite beatboxer minus the raps
rollin' with at least three choppers ryan is that
i literally keep three shottas
i'm lyrically james todd tariq trotter minus the cap
manslaughter goons under the moonlight
john wilkes that's who i'm in the booth like
ayy bruh i go ham for dead presidents
and everything i record is over your head like a boom mic
why would you irrelevant fucks want to rebel against us
knowing your smith  wesson has never been clutched
knowing you never been rushed by the most ignorant niggas invented
them niggas that'll send you to the dentist to get a whole row of elephant tusks
your teeth gone like you been on some meth and some dust forever
i see you my niggas call me the enemy watcher
the minute we spot ya the semi'll pop nigga we got ya
i'm livin' to conquer remember the mantra i'm grippin' the launcher
like em and the doctor with no guilty conscience
i'm still shockin' like droppin' a boombox in bathwater
more shockin' than a pissed off blanka
i just finished fuckin' a fish called wanda
i'm finna wander off into yonder
beyond just mentally stronger memory monster
i remember the sponsorin' thought that conquered his triple entendre
you the cross of a unicorn and the unabomber
quit horsin' around in this building or you a goner
your willy wonka persona won't help you any longer
i'm optimus i make prime examples of mini tonkas
hogtie your squad and go bonkers
spin grab denaun's guitar and honky tonk ya
all your bars subpar like good golfers
i put a hole in one of you birdies with this eagle and launch it pew
now this will probably be the most illest shit that i've ever said
god bless the dead and let biggie possess the pencil lead
they called me a sped and said that i had a messed up head
'cause i said motherfuck school and instead went to special ed
sippin' bacardi and lime i start to recollect on the time
that i startled my mom and had her scared to death
word to method man
she heard some wutang coming from towards the patio
she was like what the heck was that
she went to check on the noise and go inspect the deck
then i jumped out with a sword and yelled protect your neck
now bow to the lord hold up no better yet kneel
better yet get down on all fours and take a vow to always
rejoice in the sound of my voice but you don't have a choice
just a third of my will will overpower yours
using about a fourth to create the amount of force
it'll take to knock out a horse like a tranq full of tylenol
enter my house of horrors with a thousand floors
got a crown of thorns but it won't fit around the horns
but i'ma keep it a buck like a dollar store
i'm more than you bargained for and i am far more worse
than a fortysome bar lord jamar verse
nothing means more than respect so when i curse
you could say i swore to protect
my image i have zero time or regard for
a neverwas been claiming rap when it's not yours
if it was anyone's house g rap and rakim would be havin' you mop floors
rundmc would be havin' you cleanin' sinks
yeah your group was off the chain but you were the weakest link
rest of these youngins of mine
time to start throwing some shade this time i'm shutting the blinds
'cause when i'm looking at y'all shit it's no wonder it's why
i need a visor 'cause y'all are just sons in my eyes
born a cynic and more demented than an orphanage with a morgue up in it
next door to an abortion clinic
newborn infants tortured and tormented
with their foreheads dented when they drop 'cause the floor's cemented
their corpses get ornamented
the coroner with a storage bin rented
to store them in and the torsos of forty women reported missin'
distorted twisted this isn't no storybook ending
this is only the beginning
so lord forgive me i'm hearing voices
i can't ignore them anymore they're winning
i'm a long way away from where you are in skill

these are the results of a thousand electric volts
a neck with bolts
nurse we're losin' him check the pulse
a kid who refused to respect adults
wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
a cornylookin' white boy scrawny and always ornery
'cause i was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
and i might snap one day just like that
i decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
my first day in junior high this kid said
it's you and i three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die
i looked at my watch it was 120
i already gave you my lunch money
what more do you want from me
he said don't try to run from me you'll just make it worse
my palms were sweaty and i started to shake at first
somethin' told me try to fake a stomach ache it works
i screamed ow my appendix feel like they could burst
teacher teacher quick i need a naked nurse
what's the matter
i don't know my leg it hurts
leg i thought you said it was your tummy
oh i mean it is but i also got a bum knee
mr mathers the fun and games are over
and just for that stunt you're gonna get some extra homework
but don't you wanna give me after school detention
nah that bully wants to beat your ass and i'ma let him
way before my baby daughter hailie
i was harassed daily by this fat kid named deangelo bailey
an eighth grader who acted obnoxious 'cause his father boxes
so every day he'd shove me in the lockers
one day he came in the bathroom while i was pissin'
and had me in the position to beat me into submission
he banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose
soaked my clothes in blood grabbed me and choked my throat
i tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef
but he just wouldn't leave
he kept chokin' me and i couldn't breathe
he looked at me and said you gonna die honky
the principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me
what's going on in here
i made 'em think they beat me to death
holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
then i got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the fourinch screws
grabbed some sharp objects brooms and foreign tools
this is for every time you took my orange juice
or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
i'm gettin' you back bully now once and for good
i cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as i could
and beat him over the head with it 'til i broke the wood
knocked him down stood on his chest with one foot
made it home later that same day
started readin' a comic and suddenly everything became gray
i couldn't even see what i was tryin' to read
i went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
my mother started screamin' what are you on drugs
look at you you're gettin' blood all over my rug i'm sorry
she beat me over the head with the remote control
opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
i picked it up and screamed look bitch what have you done
oh my god i'm sorry son
shut up you cunt
i said fuck it took it and stuck it back up in my head
then i sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck
i'm tired of backstabbin'ass snakes with friendly grins
i'm tired of committin' so many sins
tired of always givin' in when this bottle of henny wins
tired of never havin' any ends
tired of havin' skinny friends hooked on crack and mini thins
i'm tired of this dj playin' your shit when he spins
tired of not havin' a deal
tired of havin' to deal with the bullshit without grabbin' the steel
tired of drownin' in my sorrow
tired of havin' to borrow a dollar for gas to start my monte carlo
i'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off
i'm tired of jobs startin' off
at 550 an hour then this boss wonders why i'm smartin' off
i'm tired of bein' fired every time i fart and cough
tired of havin' to work as a gas station clerk
for this jerk breathin' down my neck drivin' me berserk
i'm tired of usin' plastic silverware
tired of workin' at builder's square
tired of not bein' a millionaire
i'm tired of bein' white trash broke and always poor
tired of takin' pop bottles back to the party store
i'm tired of not havin' a phone
tired of not havin' a home to have one in if i did have one on
tired of not drivin' a bm
tired of not workin' at gm tired of wantin' to be him
tired of not sleepin' without a tylenol pm
tired of not performin' in a packed coliseum
tired of not bein' on tour
tired of fuckin' the same blonde whore
after work in the back of a contour
i'm tired of fakin' knots with a stack of ones
havin' a lack of funds and resortin' back to guns
tired of bein' stared at
tired of wearin' the same damn nike air hat
tired of steppin' in clubs wearin' the same pair of lugz
tired of people sayin' they're tired of hearin' me rap about drugs
tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
sayin' they wasn't feelin' me on nobody's as ill as me
and i'm tired of radio stations tellin' fibs
tired of jlb sayin' where hiphop lives

so i'm dumb enough to ask for a date with lauryn hill
some people only see that i'm white ignorin' skill
'cause i stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
but i don't get pissed y'all don't even see through the mist
how the fuck can i be white i don't even exist
i get a clean shave bathe go to a rave
die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
my middle finger won't go down how do i wave
and this is how i'm supposed to teach kids how to behave
me and marcus allen went over to see nicole
when we heard a knock at the door must've been ron gold
jumped behind the door put the orgy on hold
killed them both then smeared blood on the white bronco
we did it my mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
i slapped garth brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
i'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer
that'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
my rap style's warped i'm runnin' out the morgue
with your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
jumped in a chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
and beat up foghorn leghorn with an acorn
i'm 'bout as normal as norman bates with deformative traits
a premature birth that was four minutes late
mother are you there i love you
i never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel that shovel
will someone please explain to my brain
that i just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and i'm in pain
i take a breather and sigh either i'm high or i'm nuts
'cause if you ain't tiltin' this room neither am i

i took three she ate the other 22 caps
now she's upstairs cryin' out her eyeballs drinking lysol
she's gonna die dude
i know and it's my fault
oh my god
my favorite color is red like the bloodshed
from kurt cobain's head when he shot himself dead
women all grabbin' at my shish kabab
bought lauryn hill's tape so her kids could starve
i can't stand white people
you thought i was ill and now i'm even more so
shit i got fullblown aids and a sore throat
i got a wardrobe with an orange robe
i'm in the fourth row signin' autographs at your show
i just remembered that i'm absentminded
wait i mean i've lost my mind i can't find it
i'm freestylin' every verse that i spit
'cause i don't even remember the words to my shit um one two
i told the doc i need a change in sickness
and gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
put my lp on your christmas gift list
you want to get high here bitch just sniff this
yo yo yo yo yo
i tried suicide once and i'll try it again
that's why i write songs where i die at the end
'cause i don't give a fuck like my middle finger was stuck
and i was wavin' it at everybody screamin' i suck i suck
i go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
and yell out loud all y'all get the hell out now
fuck rap i'm givin' it up y'all i'm sorry
but eminem this is your record release party
i'm bored out of my gourd so i took a hammer
and nailed my foot to the floorboard of my ford
guess i'm just a sick sick bastard
who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket i ain't got it all
one excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
i feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage oh
and if you ever see a video for this shit
i'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit
got bitches on my jock out in east detroit
'cause they think that i'm a motherfuckin' beastie boy
so i told 'em i was mike d
they was like gee i don't know he might be
i told 'em meet me at kid rock's next concert oh really
i'll be standin' by the loch ness monster okay
peace out bye
then i jetted to the weed house smoked out
'til i started bustin' freestyles broke out
then i dipped quick back to the crib put on lipstick
crushed up the tylenol and ate it with a dipstick
made a couple of crank calls collect brrrt
it's ken kaniff from connecticut can you accept
i want to make songs all the fellas dub
and murder every rich rapper that i'm jealous of
so just remember when i bomb your set
yo i only cuss to make your mom upset
i feel like i'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net
poppin' percocet i'm a nervous wreck
i deserve respect but i work a sweat for this worthless check
i'm 'bout to burst this tec at somebody to reverse this debt
minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
full of venom and rage 'specially when i'm engaged
and my daughter's down to her last diaper it's got my ass hyper
i pray that god answers maybe i'll ask nicer
watchin' ballers while they flossin' in they pathfinders
these overnight stars becomin' autographsigners
we all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
along with the small fries and average halfpinters
but playerhaters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas
'cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
money'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless
them snakes slither in the grass spineless
my life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
i'm hopin' things look up but there ain't no job openings
i feel discouraged hungry and malnourished
livin' in this house with no furnace unfurnished
and i'm sick of workin' deadend jobs with lame pay
and i'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day
but fuck it if you know the rules to the game play
'cause when we die we know we all goin' the same way
'cause it's cool to be the player but it sucks to be the fan
when all you need is bucks to be the man plus a luxury sedan
or comfortable and roomy in a 6
but they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
who walk around depressed and smoke a pound of cess a day
and yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
my daughter wants to throw the ball but i'm too stressed to play
live half my life and throw the rest away
there's people that love me and people that hate me yup
but it's the evil that made me
this backstabbin' deceitful and shady mhm
i want the money the women the fortune and fame
that means i end up burnin' in hell scorchin' in flame
that means i'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name
this lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'cause right now i feel like i've just hit the rock bottom
i've got problems now everybody on my block's got 'em duh
i'm screamin' like them two cops when 2pac shot 'em
holdin' two glocks hope your doors got new locks on 'em
my daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
and them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em
and while you flaunt 'em
i could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em
i got a couple of rings and a brandnew watch you want 'em
'cause i ain't never went gold off one song
i'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn
slim shady brain dead like jim brady
i'm a m80 you little like that kim lady
i'm buzzin' dirty dozen naughty rotten rhymer
cursin' at you players worse than marty schottenheimer

you gettin' knocked the fuck out like mike tyson pssh
the proof is in the puddin' just ask deshaun holton
i'll slit yo' motherfuckin' throat worse than ron goldman
i'm nicer than pete but i'm on a search to crush a milkbone
i'm everlastin' i melt vanilla ice like silicone
i'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
i'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
flavor with no seasoning this is the sneak preview
i'll diss yo' magazine and still won't get a weak review
i'll make yo' freak leave you smell the folgers crystals
this is lyrical combat gentlemen hold your pistols
but i form like voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
slim shady mm was the old initials byebye
extortion snortin' supportin' abortion
pathological liar blowin' shit outta proportion
the looniest zaniest spontaneous sporadic
impulsive thinker compulsive drinker addict
half animal half man
dumpin' yo' dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
with more holes than an afghan
somebody let me out this limousine hey let me out
i'm a caged demon
on stage screamin' like rage against the machine
i'm convinced i'm a fiend
shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
clinically braindead i don't need a second opinion
fuck droppin' a jewel i'm flippin' a sacred treasure
i'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher
i can't take the pressure i'm sick of bitches
sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while i'm washin' dishes
in school i never said much too busy havin' a head rush
doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
then i went to jim beam that's when my face grayed
went to gym in eighth grade  the women's swim team
don't take me for a joke i'm no comedian
too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
i'm goin' up over the curb drivin' on the median
finally made it home but i don't got the key to get in
i hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters
who swallow lit roaches and light up like jackolanterns
outsidaz baby and we suin' the courts
'cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source

it all started when my mother took my bike away
'cause i murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave

slappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors
class clown freshman dressed like les nessman

and took her up to the highest divin' board and tossed her down

i went to grab my gun that's when her ass put it on me stop
with an uppercut hit me with a basket of laundry ooh
i fell through the glass doors started causin' a scene
slid across the floor and flew right into a washin' machine
jumped up with a broken back thank god i was smokin' crack
all day and doped up on coke and smack
all i wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
now i wanna kill her but yo i gotta catch her first
ran through rally's parkin' lot and took a shortcut
saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch up
kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
looked around the room
that's when i seen her bedroom door shut
i know you're in there bitch i got my gun cocked
you might as well come out now
she said come in it's unlocked
i walked in and all i smelled was liz claiborne
and seen her spread across the bed naked watchin' gay porn

i turned around to run twisted my ankle and sprained it
she came at me at full speed nothin' could stop her
i shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
i started to beg no please let go

i wanna be killed twice uhhuh
i just wanna scare somebody with a gun threat
when they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet
so bring the money by tonight
'cause your wife said this the biggest knife
she ever saw in her life help me help me
i try to keep it positive and play it cool
shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
stay in school
cause i'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
tonight i think i'll write my biggest fan a fuckyou letter
yo i'll listen to your demo tape and act like i don't like it
ahh that shit is wack
six months later you'll hear your lyrics on my shit
that's my shit
people don't buy shit no more they just dub it
that's why i'm still broke and had the numberone club hit
yup uhhuh
but they love it when you make your business public
so fuck it i've got herpes while we on the subject uhhuh
and if i told you i had aids y'all would play it
'cause you stupid mothafuckas think i'm playin' when i say it
well i do take pills don't do speed
don't do crack don't do coke i do smoke weed uhhuh
don't do smack i do do shrooms do drink beer yup
i just wanna make a few things clear
my baby mama's not dead she's still alive and bitching
and i don't have herpes my dick's just itchin'
it's not syphilis and as for being aidsinfested
i don't know yet i'm too scared to get tested
i don't speak i float in the air wrapped in a sheet
i'm not a real person i'm a ghost trapped in a beat
i translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
and the noise is spread
picked up and transmitted through royce's head uhh
trap him in his room possess him and hoist his bed
'til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
told him each one of his boys is dead ohh
i asked him to come to the dark side
he made a choice and said yo
who hard yo i done heard worse
we can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
to see which one'll swerve first
two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity
holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets
kissed the cheek of the devil intelligence level
is hellier than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto
dismissal i'm not a fair man disgraced the race of an atheist
interceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
one track sliced without swords i buried the christ corpse
in my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse
and stay overworked it's like the nazis and the nation
collaboratin' attemptin' to take over the earth
we ain't eager to be legal
so please leave me with the keys to your jeep eagle
i breathe ether in three lethal amounts
while i stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle ahh
releasin' rage on anybody in squeezin' range
cold enough to make the seasons change into freezin' rain
he's insane no i'm not i just want to shoot up
and i'm pissed off 'cause i can't find a decent vein
the disaster with dreads i'm bad enough to commit suicide
and survive long enough to kill my soul after i'm dead
when in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
'cause i serve any stranger with money
i spray a hundred man until they joint chains
while slippin' bullets at pointblank range like they was punches
piss on a flag and burn it murder you then come to your funeral
service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
whippin' human ass throwin' blows crackin' jaws
with my fists wrapped in gauze dipped in glue and glass
i'm blazin' emcees at the same time amazin' emcees
somehow emcees ain't that eyebrowraisin' to me
from all of angles of us flash a mac loud enough
to cast a avalanche and bust 'til volcanoes erupt
i used to be a loudmouth remember me uhuh
i'm the one who burned your house down oh
well i'm out now shit
and this time i'm comin' back to blow your house up
and i ain't gon' leave you with a window to jump out of
give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
and you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms
and when i go to hell and i'm gettin' ready to leave
i'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe
i'm zonin' off of one joint stoppin' the limo
hopped in the window shoppin' a demo at gunpoint
a lyricist without a clue what year is this
fuck a needle here's a sword body pierce with this
livin' amuck never givin' a fuck
give me the keys i'm drunk and i've never driven a truck
but i smoke dope in the cab
i'll stab you with the sharpest knife i can grab
come back the next week and reopen your scab yeah
a killer instinct runs in the blood
emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud
i've calmed down now i was heavy once into drugs
i could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
my brain's gone my soul's worn my spirit is torn
the rest of my body's still bein' operated on
i'm ducked the fuck down while i'm writin' this rhyme
'cause i'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin' this time
i walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
and cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
i'll hang you 'til you dangle and chain you with both ankles
and pull you apart from both angles
i wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins
and bust open like broken water mains
so tell saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb
'cause i'm crushin' the whole world in my palm
got your girl on my arm and i'm armed with a firearm
so big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
buy your mom a shirt with a slim shady ironon
and the pants to match here momma try 'em on
i get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
a brain full of adverbs and a box full of laxatives
shittin' on rappers causing hospital accidents
god help me before i commit some irresponsible acts again
i wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
spent a million a track and went over my budget oh shit
now how in the fuck am i supposed to get out of debt
i can't rap anymore i just murdered the alphabet
drug sickness got me doin' some bugged twitches
i'm withdrawin' from crack so bad my blood itches
i don't rap to get the women fuck bitches
give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
never ran with a clique i'm a posse
kamikaze strappin' a motherfuckin' bomb across me
from the second i was born my momma lost me
i'm a cross between manson esham and ozzy
i don't know why the fuck i'm here in the first place
my worst day on this earth was my first birthday

hi rene oh hi
i was just about to toss a live grenade
in your driveway and drive away what
are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with aids
blood drippin' from it
rippin' your stomach like a paper mch
you talk a lot of shit but you was never ill though
i'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
tipped over some cows just for a joke and a laugh
jumped up choked a giraffe
snapped his neck and broke it in half
wagin' wars went on stage
and sprayed cage with agent orange
and wiped my ass with his page in source here
the demon is here i'm steamin' this year
i rip  voice box out and scream in his ear
it's not a gimmick bitch it's an image i live it
give a fuck i don't know what a fuck is to give it
yeah i don't think this guy is well
i'm high as hell i'll beat you with a live cat
when i'm swingin' him by his tail
i'll fuckin' i'll fuckin' lay your nuts on the dresser
just your nutsack by itself
and bang them shits with a spiked bat
cut your neck off then sew your head right back
and leave you like that
you just triggered a prick who just mixed liquor
who's itchin' to leave you disfigured
and stiffer than christopher reeves
i was dealing with strep throat
while your mother was breastfeeding
and gave her the flesheating disease
i'm iller than takin' a hammer and beating your knees
and walkin' through south central la bleeding in jeans
am i a blood or a crip
wakin' up the next day in breathing machines
flashin' back to bein' shot and repeating the scenes
on how you just got smoked and if you do live
you'll be too scared to tell it like a biggie and pac joke
all you see is the sun reflectin' off of the gun
ready for the showdown to go down at one
sweat on my brow let's settle it now
i'ma show you how real cowboys get down
i'm polishin' gold waitin' for this drama to unfold
i got a blunt rolled
feelin' bold gangsta's blood runs cold
it's time to reload this old 45 colt
the wind's gusty it's hot muggy and dusty
bust a couple shots make sure i'm not rusty
it's past noon he should be here soon
sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
all of a sudden i can hear the sound of hoofs
sounds like a thousand wolves
i cock back put the toast in the holster and froze
i pose like a poster he's closer than close
i hold the heat sturdy i heard he fights dirty
but i'ma put 30 inside him and leave early
and just when i went to fill him with hot lead
i put the gun to his head and this is what he said
you never met me you'll probably never see me again
but i know you the name's slim you want revenge
then don't shoot i'm in the same boots as you
i'm telling the truth i got a price on my head too
'cause when you
he was shady i seen by the look on his face
he said take ten paces shit i took eight
spun around and i aimed straight for the brain
my shit went bang but it only fired a blank he said
you need bullets hurry up run
i put a clip in the gun and pointed at his lungs
we both drew at the same time and stood stunned
go ahead shoot me but i'm not the one you want
i figured he was tellin' the truth that's why i didn't shoot
so what we gon' do it's on you
do you recall when you and snoop was a group
the chronic
well all we gotta do is find a map to part two
and plus i know who's got it
who
some old dude who's got 26 plaques
and he already sold two
loaded up my saddle got ready for battle
hid two pieces of gold inside of my satchel
we rolled two miles until we hit the spot
an old ghost town that everybody forgot
a place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
slim grabbed the shotgun
dre here's the plot
this is the spot they call him doc loveless
he's going around saying he took the game from us
let's shoot him in his kneecaps he'll never see it comin'
he ain't got no legs they cut them off at the stomach
he's got mechanical legs he spins webs
plus he's wellrespected by the hiphop heads
our mission is to get him to stop layin' eggs
and we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
i drew two guns spun them on my fingers
kicked the swingin' doors in started gunslingin'
i could hear somebody singin' it sounded like a g thang
and a verse from keep their heads ringin'
i said it's dre's day and started to spray
it's 1800 he pulls a ak
hollow tips started flyin' every which way
that's when i seen dre in trouble and came with the gauge
i fired the first shot spun his body around
he hit the ground and landed upside down
dre grabbed the map the plaques and the gold
i grabbed two girlies and a blunt that's rolled
all you see is the sun reflectin' off of the gun
ready for the showdown to go down at one
sweat on my brow let's settle it now
i'ma show you how real cowboys get down
i'm polishin' gold waitin' for this drama to unfold

impulsive thinker compulsive drinker addict
half animal half man
dumpin' yo' dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
with more holes than an afghan
somebody let me out this limousine hey let me out
i'm a caged demon
on stage screamin' like rage against the machine
i'm convinced i'm a fiend
shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
clinically braindead i don't need a second opinion

i'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher
i can't take the pressure i'm sick of bitches
sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while i'm washin' dishes
in school i never said much too busy havin' a head rush
doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
then i went to jim beam that's when my face grayed
went to gym in eighth grade raped the women's swim team
don't take me for a joke i'm no comedian
too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
i'm goin' up over the curb drivin' on the median

maybe i need to stir up shit preferably
shake the world up if it were up to me
paul wants me to chill y'all want me to ill

old me killed the new me watch him bleed to death
i breathe on the mirror i don't see my breath

hang it on a spike fence bang it with a pipe wrench
while i take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
like vice president mike pence
back up on my shit in a sidekick as i lay it on a spike strip
these are things that i'd rather do than hear you on a mic
since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
jesus christ man how many times is
someone gonna fuck on my bitch fuck my side chick

but as cold as i get on the mic
i polarize shit so the thames might freeze

i mailed the bitch back and said if i did that
i'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
especially an effing recovery clone of me nfing
so fingerbang chicken wang mgk igg' azae'
lil pump lil xan imitate lil wayne
i should aim at everybody in the game pick a name
i'm fed up with bein' humble
and rumor is i'm hungry i'm sure you heard rumblings
i heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
i heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbojumbo
the era that i'm from will pummel you that's what it's comin' to
what the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it
i'm gonna crumble you and i'll take a number two
and dump on you if you ain't joyner
if you ain't kendrick or cole or sean then you're a goner
i'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
i guess when you walk into bk you expect a whopper
you can order a quarter pounder when you go to mcdonald's
but if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get revival
but y'all are actin' like i tried to serve you up a slider
maybe the vocals shoulda been autotuned
and you woulda bought it
but sayin' i no longer got it
'cause you missed a line and never caught it
'cause it went over your head because you're too stupid to get it
'cause you're mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest
with your expertise and knowledge but you'll never be an artist
and i'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
what i'll never be is flawless all i'll ever be is honest illa illa illa
even when i'm gone they're gonna say i brought it
even when i hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
with a bottle full of malt liquor
but i couldn't bottle this shit any longer
the fact that i know that i'ma hit my bottom
if i don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
i don't see why y'all even started with me
i get in beefs my enemies die
i don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
i'm east side never be caught slippin'
now you see why i don't sleep not even a wink i don't blink
i don't doze off i don't even nod to the beats
i don't even close my fuckin' eyes when i sneeze
aw man that bet cypher was weak it was garbage
the thing ain't even orangeoh my god that's a reach
shout to all my colorblind people
each and everyone of y'all if you call a fire engine green
aquamarine or you think water is pink
dawg that's a date  looks like an olive to me
look there's an apple  no it's not it's a peach
so fingerbang pootie tang
burger king gucci gang dookie dang
charlamagne gonna hate anyway doesn't matter what i say
give me donkey of the day
what a way for 2018 to get underway
but i'm gonna say everything that i wanna say
welcome to the slaughterhouse bitch yeah
invite 'em in like a one a day
i'm not done preach
'cause i feel like the beast of burden
that line in the sand was it even worth it
'cause the way i see people turning's
makin' it seem worthless it's startin' to defeat the purpose
i'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
and i was just tryin' to do the right thing but word
has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
or still yet to be determined
'cause i'm determined to be me critiqued or worshipped
but if i could go back i'd at least reword it
and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent
sold the dream to that he's deserted
but i think it's workin'
these verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
and he's too scurred to answer me with words
'cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
but i know at least he's heard it
'cause agent orange just sent the secret service
to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin' him
or ask if i'm linked to terrorists
i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists
but my beef is more media journalists
hold up hold up hold up
i said my beef is more meaty a journalist
can get a mouthful of flesh
and yes i mean eating a penis
'cause they've been pannin' my album to death
so i've been givin' the media fingers
don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
but they've been puttin' me through the ringer
so i ain't ironin' shit out with the press
but i just took this beat to the cleaners
i'm somewhat outlandish they say
you say we're cut from the same cloth
but i guess you fabricate eh
you better bring more men than the latter day saints
manic states stephen paddock with automatic stay sprayin'
at anything that may stand in they way

muscles flexin' gotta strut like a front suspension

and gave me enough gas to flood my engine yeah
psychopath michael jack's blowin' up like a raft

revival didn't go viral

and i shoot from the hip when i grip them things
and my lips are the clips got the sig lit like it's nicotine

bars are like bullets when i spit them schemes
that's why i call the motherfuckers m16s woo
float like a butterfly i'm gonna sting like a bee
you ain't harmin' a thing
i hit a ding hard as i'm gonna swing
i'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling
but like a wedding band

anomaly i'm muhammad ali
'cause i knew one day hey i'm gonna be the
back on my bullshit my back to the wall

i ain't no gangster but i got some bangers
some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
choppers and jammies a partridge a pear tree
my 12 days of christmas was nothin' but lies i
run at you hard like a sumo sumo
they say i talk like a chulo chulo
i live on mars i'm not bruno woo
bitch i'm a dog call me cujo rah
you play your cards i reverse on you all
and i might just draw 4 like a uno bup
cllate boca mejor maricn little puto and all of you culo joyner
they've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
lookin' for somethin' i prolly can never find now
shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
in truth a nigga just really want me tied down
i've been alone and i never needed nobody
just only me and my shotty i'll tell these niggas to lie down
keep all the money i never wanted the lifestyle
i just pray to god that my son'll be alright now
i said ain't no love for the other side
or anyone who ever want smoke joyner
when i die i'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope yeah
you in the wrong cab down the wrong path
nigga wrong way wrong road woo woo
snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
i just bought a fuckin' lawn mower vroom
i got a couple of mansions
still i don't have any manners
you got a couple of ghostwriters
but to these kids it don't actually matter
they're askin' me what the fuck happened to hiphop
i said i don't have any answers
'cause i took an l when i dropped my last album
it hurt me like hell but i'm back on these rappers
and actually comin' from humble beginnings
i'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
i wish i could say what a wonderful feeling
we're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling
but nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
to even stick to a subject it's killin' me
the inability to pen humility
hatata batata why don't we make a bunch of
fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em
fuck it i'm goin' for the jugular
shit is a circus you clowns that are comin' up
don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
about the ones that were here before you that made rap
let's recap way back mc's that wreak havoc on tape decks
adat's where the g raps and kanes at
we need 3 stacks asap and bring masta ace back
'cause half of these rappers have brain damage
all the lean rappin' face tats syruped out like tree sap
i don't hate trap and i don't wanna seem mad
but in fact where the old me at the same cat
that would take that feedback and aim back i need that
but i think it's inevitable
they know what button to press or what lever to pull
to get me to snap though lil' bitch
and if i pay it attention i'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
but you've been takin' ya dicks in the fuckin' back ho get it
on the brink any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
i'm asleep at the wheel again
as i peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
of another beat i'ma kill again
'cause even if i gotta end up eatin' a pill again
even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
it better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
and i might as well 'cause i'ma end up bein' a villain again
levels to this shit i got an elevator
you could never say to me i'm not a fuckin' record breaker
i sound like a broken record every time i break a record
nobody could ever take away the legacy i made i never cater
motherfucker now i got a right to be this way
i got spite inside my dna
but i roll 'til the wheels fall off i'm workin' tirelessly ayy
it's the moment y'all been waitin' for
like california wishin' rain to pour
in that drought y'all been prayin' for
my downfall from the 8 mile to the southpaw
still the same marshall that outlaw
that they say as a writer might've fell off
i'm back on that bull like the cowboy
she thinks i'm bein mean and now
she starts to scream and shout
shes about to let the demons out
she don't wanna see me with other females out
i tell the bitch to beat it take the scenic route
she retaliates by tryin to leave the house
in an evening gown with her cleavage out
we've been down this road too many times for me to count
and all i can think is how
and i don't know what's got a hold of me
most notably i've been zonin' to jodeci
i'm totally open hopelessly devoted
so much so that i bet you she don't even know that she's
the first thing i think of when i wake up
and the last thing i think of 'fore i go to sleep
sike hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
i know she cheats so do i i'm soulless she's heartless
no wonder we're partners
both got hundreds of charges
domestic disputes but we've always
swept it under the carpet
even when 911 gets the call that
i slipped up and busted her jaw with
a louisville slugger 'cause alls it
really does is make our love
for each other grow stronger
she won me over the second she tried to run me over
told her i'd keep it a hun' we over
kicked her out called her back now she's coming over
but why is she so wicked
and how the fuck did i get so twisted
up with someone so unlikable and shifty
we're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
ignitable liquids but i'm finally seeing
she's only mine for the time being
that's why i keep bringin' up that one time she
tried to twotime me
and throw it up in her face 'til i dry heave
how could i be so naive
should i leave or turn this entire evening
into a motherfucking crime scene
maybe i'm just too ugly to compete with him
you weren't s'posed to agree you fucking bitch
'specially when you're the one cheated first
now the argument immediately becomes heated
you don't want me to flip little conceited cunt
eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
slut treat it just like a drum beat it
complete it and once you've succeeded repeat it
i love you but i hope you fuckin' die though
in our business your friends like to pry so
you've got 'em all under cover just like moles
hopin' they'll come back with intel
but i'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'cause now the roles are reversed so here i go
thinkin' i'm sly as i scroll through your iphone
who the fuck's milo
the guy at work who drives a hilo
i put a tracking device on your chrysler
and follow you while you drive home
but like a cyclone i just got my disguise blown
you recognize me and had milo flip me off
right out the passenger side window beepbeep
i hit a light pole you skirt off
and then pull up at 5 am in the drive in a stretched white limo
stumble in the side door and hit me in the head with milo's demo
but like a drunk bum what do i know
let's sleep on it like they did revival
i told you you're the apple of my eye so shut your pie hole
it's 2002 everything was totally new
we were globally huge watchin' sales go through the roof
we wrote and we feuded runyon avenue soldiers included
a multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse
we were so bulletproofwrote souped and soaked in our youth
thought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe
the death of doody broke us in two
we were thrown for a loop ain't none of us know what to do
and at the time i was goin' through my own struggles too
so i wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through
everyone tried to go solo really nobody blew
i was hopin' they do so i ain't have to shoulder the crew
the plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
how to stand on their own and i don't wanna open up wounds
i just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth
'cause the truth is the moment that proof died so did the group
shoot
it was never the same and it's bothered me since
and the farther we drift apart the more awkward it gets
the more time goes by the more life happens
and we gotta be men we got responsibilities
plus we don't say how we feel
and i feel like this is what got us in the debacle we're in
been with you guys thick and thin
but it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
which reminded me biz rockstar was the shit
y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit
if you woulda put d12 on it wish i coulda did
more than try talkin' you into comin' up off of it
i know it wasn't my fault but part of it probably is
i think of all of the trips to bet
and the rappers i wish that we woulda politicked with
maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
but that's water under the bridge
but i'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed
bacardi and hen' never thought the party would end
one minute you're bodyin' shit but then your audience splits
you can already sense the climate is startin' to shift
to these kids you no longer exist
went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
to tiny drops little drips
and by the time your reign is over you'll hardly be missed
you start thinkin' of all the artists you dissed
all the carnage you left is this the kind of karma you get
for turnin' your fuckin' back on bizzy kuniva and swift
a freudian slip subconsciously i honestly wished
i ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
but it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none
i just wish i had words but i guess there just are none for this
to my partners i can't say how sorry i am
this is not how i planned for our story to end
i love all of you men
but i just can't be the guy everybody depends
on for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair
i will always be here but that spark isn't there
and i don't know how to recapture that time and that era
i've tried hearkening back to but i'm fightin' for air
i'm barely chartin' myself
feels like i'm on the descent but it was not my intent
to treat y'all like a stepping stone
though i ain't left no one behind but we been down every road
done all we possibly can i know we kept our hopes up
but the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live
the less is left for closure so let's let this go
it's not goodbye to our friendship but d12 is over
i don't do jordans and audemars
i do explosions and molotovs
y'all blowin' smoke as if y'all ain't washed
i blow the smoke from the car exhaust
flyin' to a party i am not invited to feelin' like the streets need me
i ain't gotta dance long as my ferrari spider move like c breezy
i don't gotta hire goons
i'd rather try to buy the moon and breathe freely
the sky is blue the tires new
the maserati white and cool like geazy
why these dudes tryna figure out
how to do a freestyle as fly as me why
i'm confused tryna figure out how to do kapri styles and mya g
everybody doin' chick joints
probably rob these little dudes at fist point
'member everybody used to bite nickel
now everybody doin' bitcoin
we don't got nothin' in common no
we don't got nothin' in common no
y'all into stuff like doubledup styrofoam cups
on them uppersanddowners woo
i'm into stuff like doublin' commas
find me a brother who's solid
to count the shit up and then bust the shit down
when the cops hit us up we can flush the shit down
we cannot give a fuck shit a fuckin' colonic
sellin' your cock and your butt for a follower
possible couple of dollars you powder sniff
now you slippin' call it a power trip a product of politics
y'all went from profit and toppin' the charts
to dropped in the park in a pile of shit
knowledge is power but powerless
if you've got it and you do not acknowledge it
y'all music sound like dr seuss inspired it
hirin' strippers prostitutes retirin'
we can spit it for your advance
i'm fit to be king you're cut out to fit in prince pants
you niggas
you say you're affiliated with murderers killers ayy
the people you run with are thuggin' gang
but you just a wannabe gunner gang
like you was gonna do somethin'
actin' like you catchin' bodies ayy
and you got juice lil' youngin' you buggin'
you ain't never even been charged in connection with battery
bitch you ain't plugged into nothin'
rap god spit lyrical bullets pew
and gats cock your partners better tool up
this has not to do with muscular
but have guns for sure you better put a
strap on other words if you're gonna
roll up with your gang you're gon' need a arsenal
'cause this bar is over your head
so you bettergun cockhave arms if you're gonna pull up skrrt
oh you run the streets huh
now you wanna come and fuck with me huh
this little cocksucker he must be feelin' himself
he wants to keep up his tough demeanour
so he does a feature decides to team up with n9na
but next time you don't gotta use tech n9ne
if you wanna come at me with a sub machine gun
and i'm talkin' to you
but you already know who the fuck you are kelly

but keep commenting on my daughter hailie
i keep on telling motherfuckers
but just in case you forgot really and need ja memories jarred like strawberry or pineapple apricot jelly
i respond rarely but this time shady 'bout to sound off
like a fuckin' cocked semiglock demigod
let me put a fuckin' silencer on this little
nonthreatening blond fairy cornball takin' shots at me
you're not ready fool break yourself like rock steady crew
obviously i'm not getting through
we can get it poppin' like redenbach letting off like remy ma
heavy artillery godzilla harsh with a hard shell
with a motherfucking heart bigger than bizarre's belly
only time you'll ever say i lost
you'll be talkin' 'bout fetty wap better call diddy
just to try to get me off
and you better hope i don't call trick trick
bitch this shit don't fly in our city
punk you don't disrespect ogs rip prodigy
sold dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me
that i'll be the most hated though made it

'cause life is a bitch she's a bowlegged ho
but now those days are over

invisible with the pen i'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals

a little bit unpredictable i spit the formidable
that you bitches fuckin' with the original

sponge mug folder nun rug holster
lug nut coaster lung jug roaster
young thug poster unplugged toaster

so spit that shit from the heart you didn't write like you wrote it wrote it yeah
while i teabag the microphone 'cause i go nuts on it on it yeah
like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
headed right at opponents and i'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
i'm 'bout to
i turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when i wasn't wasn't
from the moment i heard rappers cussin' i was in was in
which is why i identify with the guy
who i was invented by dre's frankenstein
energized like a nine volt
ice cold like snake eyes twice in a row on a dice roll
but if the only reason i blowed is 'cause i'm white though
why don't every other white rapper sell what i sold ooh
kamikaze pilot i wrote my suicide note
here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'fore i jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes

mine are higher so when you compare our views you get overlooked
and i don't say the hook unless i wrote the hook
and now i'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
and you know i've always spoke the truth
you're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
and it ain't somethin' i need a phone to do
when i say i can't wait 'til i get ahold of you
and i don't know what i'm s'posed to do
line up the rappers take my pic like a photo shoot
gotta concentrate against the clock i race

went from addict to a workaholic word to dr dre
in that first marijuana tapeguess i got a chronic case yeah
and i ain't just blowin' smoke 'less it's in your momma's face
i know this time paul and dre
they won't tell me what not to say nope
and though me and my party days
have all pretty much parted ways
you'd swear to god i forgot i'm the guy that made not afraid
one last time for charlamagne
if my response is late it's just how long it takes
to hit my fuckin' radar i'm so far away
these rappers are like hunger games
one minute they're mockin' jay
next minute they get their style from migos or they copy drake
maybe i just don't know when to turn around and walk away
but all the hate i call it walkonwatergate
i've had as much as i can tolerate
i'm sick and tired of waitin' i done lost my patience
i can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
you wanted shady you got him
somebody tell budden before i snap he better fasten it
or have his body bag get zipped
the closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches pump it up
and don't make me have to give it back to akademiks
say this shit is trash again i'll have you twisted
like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
even when i'm gettin' brain you'll never catch me with a thot
lacking with it he ain't spittin' like this on his last shit

my attack is vicious jack the ripper back in business
tyler create nothin' i see why you called yourself a faggot bitch
it's not just 'cause you lack attention
it's because you worship d12's balls you're sackreligious
if you're gonna critique me
you better at least be as good or better
get earl the hooded sweater
whatever his name is to help you put together
some words more than just two letters
the fans waited for this moment like that feature
when i stole the show ha sorry if i took forever haha
just remember i was here before you
and i'll be here after you make your runin for you
detractors i might have to fuck pitchfork with a corkscrew
just what the doctor ordered
revenge is the best medicine yeah
increase the dose from least to most
and then tell the grammys to go and fuck themselves
they suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
so they nominate 'em get 'em there get a name to mc the show
every parasite needs a host haha
then give album of the year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
all i know is i wrote every single word to everything i ever murdered
time to separate the sheep from goats yeah
and i got no faith in your writers i don't believe in ghosts
when rap needed it most i was that wing and a prayer huh
a beacon of hope put a bird in the air
somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lipsyncs in the mirror
that's who i'm doin' it for the rest i don't really even care
but you would think i'm carryin' an oxford dictionary in my pocket
how i'm buryin' these artists
on a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
mine says 'very' yours says 'hardly'
and what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause i'm just barely gettin' started woo
and far as lord jamar you better leave me the hell alone
or i'll show you an elvis clone
walk up in this house you own thrust my pelvic bone
use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
put my feet up and just make myself at home yeah

but i think i got just the thing
why don't i bring my fuckin' bat and just swing by
here we go agaain from heroes to villains
used to be your romeo but we both were jilted
a couple of times so we had a slippery slope to deal with
but still it gave me hope that we'll get
through it together a severed earlobe
mailed to you in a envelope
would be dope but what kind of lengths can you go
pull a vincent van gogh just to convince a damn ho
to be a housewife who outright lies
she's blackout drunk now she's backin' out my drive
i ran outside why is she tryna act out
she's just about my size hit me in the mouth twice
guys when someone you'd die for
sticks a steak knife in your heart do you try more
another late night in she stumbles through my door
lets the daylight in and all we do's fight more
and i ain't violent but she's goin' through my drawers

in order to wipe your ass when you moved your bowels
when we renewed our vows this the thanks i get
i'm waitin' for the day i can
hear you say marshall what a skank i've been
and there's a new guy you're being replaced by him
got your tubes tied for him got that boob job for him

after you i swore to make the gray skies end

and hope that he dumps you
it's like a dream come true just to scream fuck you

'cause you just look at me and roll them little snake eyes in
since
knock knock let the devil in
manevolent as i've ever been head is spinnin'
this medicine's screamin' llllet us in
llllike a salad bowl edgar allan poe
bedridden shoulda been dead a long time ago
liquid tylenol gelatins think my skeleton's meltin'
wicked i get all high when i think i've smelled the scent
of elephant manurehell i meant kahla
screw it to hell with it i went through hell with accelerants
and blew up mymymyself again
volkswagen tailspin bucket matches my pale skin
mayo and went from hellmann's and being rail thin
filetofish scribble jam rap olympics '97 freaknik
how can i be down me and bizarre in florida
proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
dr dre said hell yeah
and i got his stamp like a postcard word to melman
and i know they're gonna hate
but i don't care i barely can wait
to hit 'em with the snare and the bass
square in the face this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
because they're gonna taste my
i said knock knock let the devil in
shotgun pppellets in the felt pen
cocked fuck around and catch a hot one
itit's evident i'm not done
vvenomous the thoughts spun
like a web and you just caught in 'em
held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
beat strangler attack
so this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
eat painkiller pills fuck up the track
like what's her name's at the wheel danica patrick
threw the car into reverse at the indy a nut crashin'
into ya the back of it just mangled steel
my mustang and the jeep wrangler grill
with the front smashed much as my rear fender assassin
slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and gandhi gandhi
translation i will probably kill us both
when i end up backin' into ya
you ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya
when you're bit with the
i said knock knock let the devil in
alien eeelliott phone home
ain't no telling when this chokehold
on this game will end i'm loco
became a symbiote so
my fangs are in your throat ho
you're snakebitten with myvenom
with the ballpoint pen i'm
gun cocked bump stock doubleaught buckshot
tire thumper a garrote tie a couple knots
fired up and caught fire juggernaut
punk rock bitch it's goin' down like yung joc
'cause the doc put me on like sunblock
why the fuck not you only get one shot
ate shit 'til i can't taste it
chased it with straight liquor
then paint thinner then drank 'til i faint
and awake with a headache
and i take anything in rectangular shape
then i wait to face the demons i'm bonded to
'cause they're chasin' me but i'm part of you
so escapin' me is impossible
i latch onto you like aparasite
and i probably ruined your parents' life
and your childhood too
'cause if i'm the music that y'all grew up on
i'm responsible for you retarded fools
i'm the super villain dad and mom was losin' their marbles to
you marvel that eddie brock is you
and i'm the suit so call me
why are expectations so high is it the bar i set
my arms i stretch but i cant reach
a far cry from it or it's in my grasp but as
soon as i grab squeeze
i lose my grip like the flying trapeze
into the dark i plummet now the sky's blackening
i know the marks high butter
flies rip apart my stomach
knowin' that no matter what bars i come with
you're gonna harp gripe and
that's a hard vicodin to swallow so i scrap these
as pressure increases like khakis
i feel the ice cracking because
it's the curse of the standard that the first of the mathers disc set
always in search of the verse that i havent spit yet
will this step just be another misstep
to tarnish whatever the legacy love or respect
ive garnered the rhyme has to be perfect the delivery flawless
and it always feels like i'm hittin the mark
'til i go sit in the car listen and pick it apart
like this shit is garbage
god's given me all this still i feel no different regardless
kids look to me as a god this is retarded
if only they knew it's a facade and its exhaustive
and i try not to listen to nonsense
but if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
mission accomplished
i'm not godsent nas rakim 'pac big james todd smith
and i'm not prince so
it's true i'm a rubik'sa beautiful mess
at times juvenile yes i goof and i jest
a flawed human i guess
but i'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex
pectations and meet 'em but first
the speedom verse now big sean
he's goin' too fast is he gonna shout or curse out his mom
there was a time i had the world by the balls eatin' out my palm
every album song i was spazzin' the fuck out on
and now i'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
but the only one who's looking down on
me that matters now's deshaun
am i lucky to be around this long
begs the question though
especially after the methadone
as yesterday fades and the dresden home
is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
the crowds are gone
and it's time to wash out the blonde
sales decline the curtain's drawn
they're closin' the set i'm still pokin' my head from out behind
and everyone who has doubt remind
now take your best rhyme outdo it now do it a thousand times
now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
or gives a fuck about your rhymes
and as i grow outta site outta mind i might go outta mine
'cause how do i ever let this mic go without a fight
when i made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine
but when i do fall from these heights though i'll be fine
i won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
but i'll decide if it's my final bow this time around 'cause
and i started from the bottom
like a snowmangroundup
like round chuck and still put hands on you
stayin' wound up is how i spend time get it
sucker free confidence high
such a breeze when i pen rhymes
i just got that air about me like wind chimes yeah
'nother day in the life uh
used to have to scrape to get by yeah
now my community's gated and i
made it and my neighbors say hi say hi
i'm givin' 'em pounds i'm upscale now
guess it means i'm way in the sky way in the sky
but i still remember the days of
minimum wage for general labor
welfare recipient since a minor
look how government assistance has made ya
adversity if at first you don't succeed
put your temper to more use
'cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
that should only give you more fuel
show 'em why you're you
so close god it's like i almost got it
but close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
so i unabomb shittick tick tickno remorse pew
screw it i'm lit and that attitude i blew up on quick
that's why they call me firecracker
i grew up on wicwick wick wickwith a short fuse
i got some important news to report to
anyone who thought i was done nah bitch not quite
spotlight's back on got my faith where's yours
man i know sometimes
these thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
to me they're just ink blots
i just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
so you might wanna think it over twice yeah
or you retards can roll the dice
but beef will at least cost you your career
'cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
but this middle finger's free as a bird
nuke warhead at birth hugest forehead on earth
too short for the verse studied his formula learned
how to incorporate a curse
point it towards corporate america
stick a fork in and turn
'cause fourletter words are more better heard
the world forcefed a turd to me you're getting yours
but sometimes i overdo it but i just get so into it
i was there consolin' you when no one knew it
when your situation showed no improvement
i was that door you walked over to it
i'm the light at the end of the tunnel
so people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
when that tunnel vision is unclear
shit becomes too much to bear
since cleanin' out my closet
when i was havin' trouble with the snare
i'm that unrealistic prayer answered
and i'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat uh
when you struggle with despair
that doublefisted bareknuckles coupled with this pair
of nuts i'm cuppin' i am your 'fuck it' switch nothin' can compare
started from the bottom like a snowman
oh man put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
but my battery's low i'ma need a boost to my pack
and i know that i always got proof at my back
i called you proof because i knew for a fact
my ace in the hole homie i'm callin' on you
'cause i think i'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it so
give me that inkling and mo
tivation to go hussein with the flow
fake fans that are twofaced didn't show
let heartbeats loop produce hate in my soul
layin' vocals two days in a row
true statement hate to go down this road
but there's only one route to cross this bridge
so i walk in this bitch with loose change
'cause all my dues paid but this booth's takin' its toll
but it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
that goes for you too so what the fuck you gon' do
use the tools you're given
or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
as an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em
i used to play the loservictim
'til i saw the way proof was driven
i found my vehicle and i haven't ran out of gas yet
and when they stacked decks turn handicaps into assets
fanny packs hourglasses
if time was on my side i'd still have none to waste
man in my younger days
that dream was so much fun to chase
it's like i'd run in place
while this shit dangled in front of my face
but how do you keep up the pace
and the hunger pangs once you've won the race
when that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grce
still you feel the need to go full tilt
that bruce willis that blue steel that true skill
when that wheel's loose i won't lose will
do you still believe
instinctive nature to bring the anguish yeah
to the english language
with this ink you haters get rode on like a piece of paper
this rap shit got me travelin' place to place
you barely leave your house
'cause you're always stuck at your pad it's stationary
yeah that's why when i brainstorm gotta write it out
simon cowell of rhymin' foul that's why you sound so shook
wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
hook it inside your mouth gohruh
that's what it's like when the mic is out
'cause i'm tearin' at your flesh with it
'til your larynx and neck are split
with these lyrics weapons expert with
like hair extensions extra clips
and you're scared to effin' death of it
bitch you're starin' at a legend that
in a pair of skechers sweatshirt ripped
and hoodie black should be strapped
to a chair or stretcher electric swear on every record bitch
finger so high in the air i'll bet your senses flip
like a barometric pressure switch
carin' less who i offend with this
i'm at your neck like pez dispense
go 'head spit your flow bitch
yeah uh haha and still conjoined at
the hip with hop still on point and poignant
skilled as floyd is
in this field and still no filter boy
i'll put you in your place yeah like a realtor boy
you still ain't in the buildin' boy
i will destroy shit even as i build it
get the drill bit pen is filled with poison
which is the source easy to still pinpoint it
like what like a real thin joint it
what comes on quilted northern
and what in a builtin toilet
yeah bitch i told you i'm a dog woof
i wouldn't heal with ointment
way i'm kickin' these fairies' tails
should write a children's storybook yeah yeah yeah
million voices in my head
but still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment
off what off the feel of going in
like like your bitch when she gives me brain
like she thinks i'm dumb
grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
'til i feel anointed
she makes iller noises
when she's with me must be from the windy city uh
pretty apparent she's a milf when blowin' me
'cause i conned her into
rippin' the condom in two woo
dick is a bargainin' tool
now i'm gettin' blew like klonopins rude jude
i go there you wouldn't
well i still have a few views in common with you
just not youtube 'cause
you're a hasbeen
that has been the case since back when
you last went and threw your hat in the race
you've been trash bitch
stick your raps in the trash bin
or end up in my next rhyme
you're a fuckboy so next time
it's gonna be heads flyin' like dez bryant
with a tec9 against rex ryan yeah
now watch me set it like correct time
all you get is sloppy seconds like a timex i
clock rejects into the next life
talking reckless but it's just my
strongest suit but you can get my colombian necktie
prostitute just climb in the humvee and let's ride
why you hitching at night
i put an end to your life sex crime
kidding aside insidious vibe
girl you know you got the prettiest eyes
but all you're getting is bribed
any old lie to try to get you inside
then we gon' end up spending the night
and i'm skinning your hide like an indian tribe
what kind of nut drives a budweiser truck
finds a slut tries to surprise her cuffs ties her up
binds up cuts slices her twice
but the muff diver must just like it rough
fuck right in her vagina blood
flies up on the visor like a geyser uh
music please enthusiast of the roofie
goal is to get a floozy inside the jacuzzi
and have a looseygoosey as cool c is with an uzi
but i am to rap what blue jeans mean to bruce springsteen
glued we be i'm trutv you're too pg
i'm schoolly d you're spoonie gee
no diss there just notice there
are no similarities that we share
besides the fact we breathe air
happily married to rap and i'm glad that we buried
the hatchet and patched it up
now i'm back to ratchet up my attack
and i'm at your mothafuckin' throat like
black boy black boy we ain't gonna lie to you
black boy black boy we don't like the sight of you
pull up on the side of you
window rolled down 'profile'
then we wonder why we see this side of you
probably comin' from the dope house
we could let you slide but your tail light is blew out
we know you're hidin' that heidi klum
on you another drug charge homie it's back inside for you
and just in case a chase might ensue we got that tried and true
pistol drew right at you we'd be delighted to unload it
in your back then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
fucked up but what the fuck am i to do
i keep tellin' myself keep doin' like you're doin'
no matter how many lives you ruin
it's for the red white and blue
time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
no one's ever indicted you
why 'cause you're a
black boy black boy we don't get your culture and
we don't care what our government's done to fuck you over man
don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
balderdash whered you get the chip on your shoulder at
why you kicking that soda can
pull your pants up we 'bout to roll up and
throw your ass in the van cuffed
you don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
our cards are close to our chest you better show your hands
and put our minds more at ease
or get shot in the thyroid comply or die boy
we're fightin' a crime war here come the swine
tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
that's what we call 'em pigsties for
they're like eyesores to police
talk to you like just a piece of trash
feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
as i kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
as this beat backspins it's like we're drifting back in
to the sixties having black skin is risky
'cause this keeps happening
throughout history africanamericans have been treated like shit
and i admit there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a
seems like the average lifespan of a white man
is more than twice than a black life span
i wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
i feel like checking out on life can't escape this circumstance
i'd rather hear 'em say die nword than die antwoord
ninja now it's better disguised banter
but that's life strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
and can't find answers
we're applying but mcdonald's
seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
so how can we have higher standards
as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter
we fight back with violence but acts like that are
black eyes on the movement
which makes black lives madder
at cops and cops madder
that's why it's at a stalemate
and can't arrive at a compromise so it's black ops
i wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops
the block is our backyards officers not the crack spot
call the attack dogs off of us man
you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
and bad cops fuck it up for the good cops and man stop
sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
who ain't acclimated to 'em like that's the way to do it
who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
and know nobody black so they act afraid of us
and that's racism the fear that a black face gives 'em
a subconscious racist
wait why are there black neighborhoods
'cause america segregated us designated us to an area
separated us sectioneight'd us
when we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us
and education sucks and every day's another
freddie gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz
why is it they treat us like dryer lint
we just want a safe environment for our kids
but cant escape the sirens
dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
the poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in
the lowest classes it's like a razor wire fence
and were trapped in these racial biases
that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
every time we see a devils face
lions tigers and bears oh my
it's more like billy clubs and gats
and we really love it when you think were guilty cause were black
but you kill each other facts
you peel each other's caps for silly stuff like hats
single mother strugglin through substance abuse
while people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
fuck your republican views
pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots
and streets act as a narrator don't gotta read comics
or be that into characters just to see that just to be black
you better be strapped with a derringer
or be capped in america like steve rogers
'cause no one oversees these cops and
all we see is 'em beat charges
we done seen 'em beat rodney king unconscious and got off
so we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
just keep marchin' 'til we reach congress
but they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
if you try to slander the flag but
somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
so they call it a kaepernick tantrum
if you don't stand for the national anthem
we raise it you better praise it
or you'll be made to feel like a traitor we'll
treat you like rodney dangerfield
home of the brave is still racist 'ville
so this whole nation feels like a plantation field
in a country that claims that its foundation was based on united states ideals
that had its natives killed
got you singin' this starspangled spiel
to a piece of cloth that represents the land of the free that made people slaves to build
he's comin' home with his neck scratched to catch flack
sweat jackets and dress slacks mismatched
on his breath's jack he's a sex addict
and she just wants to exact revenge and get back
it's a chess match she's on his back like a jetpack
she's kept track of all his internet chats
and guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
actually just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'cause she loves danger psychopath
and you don't fuck with no man's girl even i know that
but she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
knife in hand says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
so she's been on the web lately
says maybe she'll be my gwen stacy to spite her man
and i know she's using me to try to play him i don't care
hi suzanne but i shoulda said bye suzanne
after the first night but tonight i am
a onenight stand turned a twonight stand
it was come sunlight scram now we hug tight and
he found out now she feels deserted and used
'cause he left so what he did it first to her too
now how am i supposed to tell this girl that we're through
it's hard to find the words i'm aloof nervous and sue
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal i just can't say this in person to you
so i revert to the studio like holeinthewall diners
don't have to be reserved in a booth
i just feel like the person who i'm turning into's
irreversible i preyed on you like it's church at the pew
and now that i got you i don't want you
took advantage in my thirst to pursue
why do i do this dirt that i do
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'cause now with her in the womb
we can't bring her in this world shoulda knew
to use protection 'fore i bit into your forbidden fruit
fuck
always the bridesmaid never the bride hey
fuck can i say if life was a highway
and deceit was an enclave i'd be swerving in five lanes
speeds at a high rate like i'm slidin' on ice maybe
that's why i may have came at you sideways
i can't keep my lies straight
but i made you terminate my baby
this love triangle left us in a wreck tangled
what else can i say it was fun for a while
bet i really woulda loved your smile
didn't really wanna abort but fuck it
what's one more lie to tell our unborn child
yo i bust in devilish grin disgustin'
asshole freckled cheeks and a buttchin
callin' all party animals get
on the floor when i pop up on some whacamole shit
in search of a chick who's stacked and so thick
and implants are so big
she can hang me up on that rack big ol' tits
like anna nicole smith
body's bananas and sass to go with
i spot you at first glance and go shit
you wearin' those pants that don't fit
that butt won't ever give up
that's why you stick it out no matter what huh
'cause you got an ass that won't quit
so get on the horn my saxophone
grab hold of my instrument get a grasp and blow whee
you just laugh and go heehee
'cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate
that's why
i'm lookin' at your tight rear like a sightseer
your booty is heavy duty like diarrhea
the plan's to bring you to my house
you're drinkin' jack and beam
i'm thinkin' soon this tramp'll lean so we should bounce
but you're outta your tubetop
if you're thinkin' that mi casa es su casa
yeah you're a cute fox
perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk
girl you're smokin' like snoop dogg
but you must be tokin' if you think you're takin' over my quarters
there goes the dime into the jukebox
two shots of blue hpnotiq and soon i'll
turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl
so rick scratch on the break like the cue ball
turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
and excuse the locker room talk i'm just too raw
but apparently so are you ma
'cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
and that's why
so come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
but tonight curiosity overrides ya
beside ya fired up like a starter pistol
crystal let's slide hon tonight i'm your pilot
'cause you should be up in the sky girl
you're so fucking fly you belong in the mile high club
so come on baby the night's young
don't string me along i'm highstrung
we might wind up on mound like we're tryin' for the cy young
fuckin' 'fore we get to the house
screwin' our brains out like changing a lightbulb
that's why i like ya 'cause i'm crazy just like ya
now every time i get brain you screw mine up
i barely can think straight your head game is a mindfuck
so ready set aim and fire
yes babe im fallin' in like that's kinda why i love
i've drowned in high from the ashes
now i can't recall your laughter
the smoke of everything go grasp
at ends of what's left over
and the lights in every broken
blownout window screaming laughing
i hope to feel it coursing out
this is our revival
someone get this aryan a sheet
time to bury him so tell him to prepare to get impeached
everybody on your feet
this is where terrorism and heroism meet square off in the street
this chump barely even sleeps
all he does is watch fox news like a parrot and repeats
while he looks like a canary with a beak
why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet he's tryin' to divide us
this shit's like a cult but like johnny he'll only unite us
'cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does
similar to when two cars collide 'cause
our spirit's crushed and this spot's a tight one
but here the jaws of life come
to pull us from the wreckage that's what we get pride from
when we cant from our stars and stripes 'cause
this type of pickle that we're in is hard to deal
but there's always tomorrow still
if we start from scratch like a scab get the scars to heal
and band together for charlottesville
and for heather fallen heroes fill this wall with murals
nevada get up hit the damn resetter
let's start from zero this is our renewal
spray tan get rid of get a brand new better
america and here's to where it all
didn't wanna piss your base off did ya
can't denounce the klan 'cause they play golf with ya
you stay on twitter way to get your hate off
nazi i do not see a way y'all differ
and all you got are race cards bigot
the swastika with your name carved in it
should be your trademark 'cause hate's all you played off
and you just lick the plate off
so i guess it pays to feed off of chaos
so basically you ate off hitler
but you ain't ruinin' our country punk
or takin' our pride from us you won't define us
'cause like a dictionary things are lookin' up
so much got a sprained neck know we would rise up
against this train wreck and take a stand
even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
to sing the starspangled banner
this man just praised a statue of general lee
'cause he generally hates the black people degrades hispanics
take it back to the shady national convention
wish i woulda spit on it before i went to shake his hand
at the event or maybe had the wherewithal
to know that he was gonna try to tear apart
our sacred land we cherish and stand for
so hands in the air let's hear it for
the start of a brand new america
without him and be proud of where we're from
and here's to where we all
we never saw from each other's sides or eye to eye
just eye for eye lie for lie fight or flight
so much baggage need a luggage rack
but we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
up back in the news love taps when i dissed you
like it was fun actually used to run back to the booth
jump back in the studio give you a tonguelashing then you
laughed at the stomach tat with the tombstone
it was funny back in our youth
but then it wasnt after we knew
that we were done and actually through and actually through
but if there's one fraction of truth
if it could be spun back i would do
so many things different things different
'cause it was such a dumbass excuse
you hit me once and that i would use
to continue the pattern of abuse
why did i punch back girls your dad is a scumbag im confused
because
you were the beat i loved with a writer's block
the line that's hot that i forgot
we laughed a little cried a lot
i'll never forget when you came home and you held hailie
day before you went to jail and daily
how we'd wait for that mail lady
or by the phone for mom to call
and i watched you pull yourself up and we decided on
givin' it one more try despite it all
you're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
i'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
when we tied the knot when we broke the knot
every line we crossed we were supposed to not
every time we fought the insults they got thrown too far
words that we said that we didnt mean
the words that we meant that we didnt say
the ones that we thought that we shoulda said
letters written that we coulda read
which maybe woulda led to some good instead
and had this put to bed
but i'd be lyin still if i said i wasn't sittin' here askin' myself
we brought out the worst in each other
someone had to make the sparring end
'cause i loved you but i hated that me
and i don't wanna see that side again
but i'm sorry kim
more than you could ever comprehend
leavin' you was fuckin' harder than
sawing off a fuckin' body limb
once upon a time we're all we had
maybe that's what drew us
to each other it was true love
shit we never knew was possible
we might have loved each other too much
and maybe that's what made us do what
we did to each other all the screwups
'cause you always thought that you was
more in love with me
and i was thinkin' i was more in love than you was
for all the times that we thought it worked
'til we saw how wrong we were
when the dust settles now and all the dirt
if i touch the rawest nerve
all i want is for us not to hurt
and it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
but i just heard mockingbird
and got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
the purpose was not to stir up or open wounds
i've caused a few and so have you
or argue whose fault it was
partly yours partly mine but really no one's
this is so tough i'm gettin' choked up
oh fuck it we both suck
we broke up got back together
we both thought we had forever
not bad people just bad together
we were so nuts backstabbed each other
another blow struck but there's no duckin' this blow
'cause it's over and it's closure
but i'm not so sure how to close this
i just don't know how some people can be so good
at one thing and so fucked at a whole 'nother
shit it's no wonder
i'm stumbling i cant see straight
and it's my fault i got this way
i got my hands on something great
and found a way to mess it up
i did my best i tried to change
but it's just in my dna
i got my hands on something great
and found a way to fuck it up again
all my life i was told i was never nothing special
i don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'specially when all my selfesteem's
already shot to hell i'm falling helplessly
i'm embarrassed i dont want no one else to see
cause i feel like i'm a piece of shit every time she yells at me
selfishly addicted definitely doesnt help that she
makes me feel like i've died and gone to heaven
but makes life a living hell for me
she does that thing with her lip now she's melting me
i'm putty in her palms im wrapped around her finger
a yoyo on a string she lets me sit there and just dangle
until something better comes along
and she'll just drop me like a hot potato
i look like i'm in pain but i'm okay though
'cause i know she loves memy friends what do they know
in my moments of weakness
i openly admit the shit i wouldn't normally
i'm extremely selfconscious and enormously
insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
it only turns to ammunition for her in this war when she
gets goin' she don't stop when i'm up she's like a downer
when i found her it was love at first encounter
but somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter
cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for
me to walk on when i'm around her
but there's just something about her
that makes me not able to function without her
how can i get out of it when i don't know how to
i'm a doubter i'm a pessimist make a believer out of me
and show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'cause i'm going straight down the drain i'm drowning
it took a while for me to get it but i think i've figured it out
she don't want me she just don't wanna see me with someone else
the idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
to see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her health
but it annoys her to see me get the strength to say screw her
i threw up on myself i'm dumb sick i'm addicted to her
she's tryna block the door so here's how i do her
since i'm manure she's a sewer
and this time this piece of shit's running through her
i can see the light now i'm running to it
what the fuck shoulda knew it
who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it
as soon as i hopped in it she doused the car with lighter fluid
she's standing there with a rag 'bout to put the lighter to it
lit the fucking thing on fire then she threw it
i'm stumbling i cant see straight
and it's my fault i got this way
i got my hands on something great
and found a way to mess it up
i did my best i tried to change
but it's just in my dna
i got my hands on something great
and found a way to fuck it up again

as soon as i hopped in it she doused the car with lighter fluid
she's standing there with a rag 'bout to put the lighter to it
lit the fucking thing on fire then she threw it
feeling kinky lip syncing to too hort's freaky tales biatch
having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
and envisioning sneaking into where christie brinkley dwells
i know this is risky thinking but i wanna stick her like she's decals
but when murdering females
better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed
better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
if you get scratched because your dna'll
be all up under her fingernails
man he hears you i don't think he cares
he gives a fuck even his pinky swears
three personalities burstin' out of me please beware
her tv blares can't hear the creaking stairs
she's unaware in no underwear she's completely bare
turns around and screams i remember distinctly
i said i'm here to do sink repairs
chop her up put her body parts
in front of steven avery's trailer and leave 'em there
woke up it was dawn musta knew somethin' was wrong
think i'm becomin' a monster 'cause of the drugs that i'm on
donald duck's on there's a tonka truck in the yard
but dog how the fuck is ivanka trump in the trunk of my car
gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
must go above and beyond 'cause it's incumbent upon me
plus i feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde
girl that motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
second murder with no recollection of it
collectin' newspaper articles cuttin' out sections from it
memory's too fucked to remember destructive temper
cut my public defender's jugular then stuck him up in a blender
another dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably
'cause the disassembled body
was covered up in the snow since the month of november oddly
i'm wanted for questioning
them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me
still on the loose they
spotted me inside mcdonald's tuesday
in a toronto blue jays cap lookin' like your college roommate
with rihanna lupe saddam hussein bobby boucher
or was it cool j the cops is on a goose chase
just escaped from the state pen
for edited eight women who hate men
don't make it no weirder i'm naked
when i break in your basement
under your baby's play pen i lay in wait adjacent
facin' the door remainin' patient while stayin' complacent
blatant sexual implications are continuin' to get thrown
insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
left on your pillow in hopes that when you get home
you'll get the hint ho i'm in your window
but it never occurred to me i could describe a murder scene
in a verse and be charged with first degree
'cause it just happened to match up perfectly
with the massacre or the burger king burglary
no officer you see
i feel sorry for this beat sympathy pains for this track
this road is takin me back
down memory lane with this rap
i can still look out in this crowd be wowed and be taken aback
im simply stating a fact
i had wembley stadium packed
but now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast
another terrorist attacks
like a tariff blows half of madison square up alas
we perish in the blast
but that isnt scaring us we pass
nowhere we're fearless 'cause we're just
fuck doin' what you're told act like a twoyear old
shit is soon to go kaboom and blow
anyways for mc's it's a funeral
when i'm devisin' this rhyme
'cause i'm awake and you're mourning
that's why i rise and i shine
like a new day has dawned on me
gusto guts bravado
nuts and plus i kick up dust and cuss a lot
i musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
'cause some stuff that's awful
really don't mean nothin' although
there's a lot of shit i said in jest that's tough to swallow
but if at times my heart it seems
like it's in the wrong place it's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve
keanu reeves speed of life avoid or veer
or just steer toward it we're only lookin' forward
but where we're goin' we have no idea
nowhere to go but hysterical it's gettin' warm in here
i set the world on fire was born to be an arsonist
just one spark and it's lit
but i'ma still get dark on this shit
told you i'd leave my mark on this bitchwar machine
but you forced me in a corner
i'm sure to have somethin' for your rear
and in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe
go to war with me you'll end up blew to timbuktu
i send at you a tenton nuke like kim jongun
and end up ruinin' your career
but when all is said and done
and at the end of my run i'll just rewind clocks forever young
make time stop will i ever fall off that day will never come
'til the pine box bitch fuck you i'm better than i ever was
'til the bomb drops hope it never does
but i'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
this world's screwed it's already fucked
and i'm on top so everyone's just
lady you remind me of my raps on that relapse shit
'cause you got an ass thick as them accents
two asscheek implants call that an asset
'cause you could set a glass on it it's massive
from the first time i saw you i actually
said to myself i gotta meet her like a taxi
exactly love affair in the backseat
sorry if i'm being graphic
but i'm stiff as a statue you sat on a shelf
i feel like i'ma bust maybe i'm just ahead of myself
let me slow down slow your camaro
i'm tryna catch up i'm tryna jump your bones to the marrow
got me under your control and your spell
wanna wrap you up put you in a bow like an arrow
grab you by the meow hope it's not a problem in fact
about the only thing i agree on with donald is that
so when i put this palm on your cat
don't snap it's supposed to get grabbed
why you think they call it a snatch
i just wanna climb in the sack
i'ma keep it a hundred like my speedometer's at
i'm watchin' you rap i'm the dude followin' back
about six cars i'm in the 'lac and i wanna fack
hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store
but them jeans you wore are like i've never seen before
i pretend i work there while i clean the floor
checkin' you out like the clerk while he rings you up
pull out behind you when you're leavin'
and you don't even know it word yo rick man
she's brushin' her hair adjustin' her mirror
she's rappin' my shit but she wasn't aware
i was there or maybe she was and just didn't care
who knows at least that ain't up in the air for some to see
so like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink
if she ain't plannin' to do shit this summer's eve
maybe she wants to keep me company
but fuck the pep le pew shit
ain't steppin' to you bitch i say to myself
plus she's bumpin' my music ain't chasin' no tail like a skunk in heat
i could sweat her to some degree
but fuck it i'm the male let her come to me
could you repeat that again
letter come to memail sweater heat some degree fail
fuck it pull up beside her
sideswipe her dodge viper wood is so bright
i ask does she want a computer lodged in her vagina
said my dick is an apple she said put it inside her
i said
black out come to hands covered in blood
motherfuckin' gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud
i just bodied the beat so that hole musta been dug
'cause it just died like food coloring duh
so let's get turnt like a shish kabab
twist it ma like an airconditioning knob
we'd be great together
don't care if it takes forever
if i gotta wait i guess it's better late than never
you felt my heat rubbin' off on ya
i love your personality come on little mama
you're hot enough to melt rick's beat come jump in the water
i bet you get your selfesteem from your persona
with an ass to match girl
your body is lit you're striking i'm a gas
girl you're just gonna have to put them other chumps on the back burner
you got buns i got asperger's
just let me rest my head between that set of d's
while i shred mc's like cheddar cheese
that's just the thoroughbred in me ain't a better breed
my dog thinks so toolook at my pedigree roof
ma the world is what i think of you
i think you're divine so i might swing on you
i'm just kiddin' girl i wouldn't lift a finger too
unless it's the middle one to finger you
you claim if you get knocked by the cops
you'll give 'em not even a statement
walk in the arraignment
shoot the bailiff karate kick the plaintiff
gotti with the stainless
i'll just call it shoddy entertainment
if y'all was in the party gettin' faded
on molly had the audience sedated
you wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
probably let it fall and hit the pavement
but you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
bitch stop bein' a lame
your hobby isnt robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
like you was tommy lynn sells
and chainsawin' them in the basement
hardly fits your job description ain't nobody dippin'
out the back of the club like oh my god he's trippin'
only time you get the blade is
probably with the dang lawn equipment ain't it
wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
i need to stop bein' debated
you're still copyin' xeroxing
i'm still coppin' a feel
like bill cosby at will poppin' a pill
then spill oxys in jill's coffee
then send her out to the hotel lobby
a lil' wobbly and still groggy
this blond fuck's reprehensible
misconducts never sensible
kiss my butt my set of principles
is gone but 'til i get the president to respond
my pen and pencil is a missile launcher
and senator mitch mcconnells
just as big of a bitch as donald
shit's on bruh haha
let me sing this shit soprano
while i do it pizzicato
ivanka stiffarm her while i'm hittin' on melania
and this song's for all ya
these drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
like justin ross harris at a nursery
goin' ham at candy yam
on nanny cam i'm gettin' handies with the zanny xannys
in the caddy armrest i'm imaginin' objects
so i'm battin' cobwebs from a daddy longleg
in hamtramck
got the panoramic camera
xanax a banana hammock and a santa hat
i'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
with a chick that looks like janet jackson with a spanish accent
twice her age and i'm actin' half it haha
grow up
nah not that i know of y'all
basement just got a frickin' overhaul
got a stripper pole installed
started rollin' all through those klonopins
like a bowlin' ball
like an overdose on twice the ratio of propofol
and go through no withdrawal
while i get fellatio and give a facial to
an interracial blowup doll of rachel dolezal
you're so appalled em
so's my manager
bitch i amateur fuck a pro career
coast is clear but nowhere to go from here
and nobody's close so don't compare
they ain't nowhere near i'm way over here
my competition can't see me
'cause i don't own a mirror
but marshall you are terrific
so smart and gifted
i'm so narcissistic when i fart i sniff it
do a fake dab to smell my armpits whiff it
your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
but i made strides with these rape lines
i'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
like ray rice when he facetimes
bang bang bang bang time
dang knives're butcher than gay wives
you're gonna need sutures the same size
as the blade i push into caput'cha
when i pull 'em like what sleigh rides
gotta stab a bitch at least eight times
to make it on dateline
i came to stake my claim like a canine
waitin' in a buffet line
so kellyanne conway
i'm a really bad hombre
come play belly dance on me
i've been makin' wedding plans all day
eightyearold with the wordplay
girl take this pole like a survey
today wasn't my birthday
but i'm caked up like a dessert tray
so we're in shape
'cause you're in a slurrin' state
im a 10 youre an eight urinate
like what i do before after and durin' rape
you wanna get into a pissin' contest
and find out who's better
and be made a fool out of when i pull on 'em
r kelly with a full bladder r kelly with a full bladder
nonhigh school grad i'm not a scholar
but i'm so cold when i'm droppin' knowledge
my degrees is the same as i got in college zero
but nobody's hotter you owe me my respect
i owe you nada like haloti partner
blow me told you i'm so dirty homie you can throw me
in some holy water with some floaties on
and get the soap and try to get the pope to hold me
while you hose me off and nope i won't be washed
you hope to god i don't explode
i gotta blow this spot up though i got a lotta mo'
i won't put the sugar coating on it though
'cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
rap's got you drained
dead tired zapped
you feel like a wet pile of crap
but look man like the feds buggin' my phone uhhuh
i get why you're tapped
but you gotta get your fire back
catch fire get upset and fire back
is what i tell myself
when times get bad
'cause sometimes i might get sad
but i take the same advice i had
and tell myself like i used to tell hailie
when life's a drag
told her to do like her dad
don't cry get mad
'cause little baby powders
belong in diaper bags
i'm hyper by the time you see this side of me
i'm right in your ass sodomy
foot up it i stood up for the kid
who had to put up with the bullies at his school at his school
you ain't had to have no money
or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude attitude
now my dough's amountin' to a mountain
that's rised too high to count it
never asked to be rich all i did was wish
i had a dime for every time that i was doubted
but then i think about it then i'm enraged
'cause i just figured out that if i was paid
for the time i spent to put the pen to the page
it'd be minimum wage minimum wage
but it's embedded in my head i never hunted for the bread and butter
what i wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but
i'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood
i put up in the pen and when i'm dead i wonder
will they put me on a pedestal or forget i was ever this incredible
i guess i better go harder than ever 'cause
i'll never get another motherfuckin' opportunity again
to offend as many people with this i can simply because i can
you're drunk the carpet is burned
i hate to find you like this
i always find you like this
i come home and clean up your mess
what would you do without that
why do i always come back
oh what i wouldn't do for you
some nights i want to run for the hills
it's never easy with you
i cannot reason with you
but your smile is as rare as it comes
what would i do without that
maybe that's why i come back
oh what i wouldn't do for you
startin' to think we were made for each other
but one of us in this relationship is raisin' the other
you remind me of my mother
we drive one another crazy as each other
and we're both adults so there's no excuse
for the games that we play with each other
where you at at a friend's no you ain't mothafucker
but i give her the benefit of the doubt
whenever the doubt kicks in shiver when i touch her
'cause i love her so much i'm a sucker
how her bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble
she's in hot water think i caught her cheatin' again
give her another chance another one after that
i'm swimmin' in that egyptian river 'cause i'm in denial
say i don't eat shit but i got a shiteatin' grin when i smile
makin' an excuse for us to act it out
she's just actin' out with her inner child
then i set the truth on fire
'cause i'd rather believe a lie
then i breathe a sigh of relief i don't believe in
goin' to bed mad i keep on tryin'
to make a bad girl good
but haven't i stood by you in good times
and bad i'm startin' to feel like your goddamn dad
'cause i literally feel like you could die if ever should i
leave you for good and never would i
it'd be all bad never understood why they call it goodbye
but i think i'm a pretty damn good guy
and you're a good person too
i can save you i can make you change
but i keep puttin' my fuckin' foot in my mouth
every time i gotta come and bail you out
when you get in trouble that you get yourself in
and i'm in trouble but i can't leave i'll sell you out
i could never turn my fuckin' back on youwhat is that
i'm codependent i'm just now noticin' it
but somehow it's like every time i'm about to go to end it
i ain't got the cojones to do it nor the heart
our apartment's tore apart
you're usin' my heart for a dartboard
but god must've aligned stars for us
'cause somebody paired us up
and they say he ain't capable of makin' a mistake
but this one's perfect 'cause i'm
i'm packin' up my shit as much shit in the car as i can fit
and i'm just drivin' as far as i can get
away from these problems 'til all of my sorrows i forget
what's tomorrow like 'cause tonight i'm startin' life again
get to the corner and stop fuck am i goin'
besides psycho when i fantasize startin' my whole life over
yeah right oh and i might go and
get hypnotized so i don't even recognize no one
i try to look alive but there's nothin' like holdin'
your head up high when you're dead inside and i just died so in
case you're wonderin' why are my insides showin'
'cause i done spilled all my guts and those are mine so i'm
pickin' 'em up and stuffin' 'em back
fuck it i've done enough in this rap shit
recovery brought me nothin' but back
to right where i was and perhaps
this coulda been my victory lap if i wasn't on the verge of relapse
it seems to be the reoccurring main theme
the shit i would daydream as a kid i was eighteen
i went from an irate teenager to still raging
as an adult amazing back then i put anything
into the rhyme whether it was sad mad happy or angry
i spit it the mainstream i hit it
yay me i did it did what
hailie baby i didn't mean to make you eighty
percent of what i rapped about
maybe i shoulda did a better job at separating
shady and entertaining from real life
but this fame thing is still the hardest thing to explain
it's the craziest shit i
ever seen and back then it was like i ain't even
bothered taking into consideration
you one day being older and may hear me say things
i didnt a mean and b just aint me
okay so ladies and gentlemen
let's strip away everything and see the main reason that i
feel like a lame piece of shit i sound cranky and bitter
complain beef and bicker 'bout the same things
'cause when i look at me i don't see what they see
i feel ashamed greedy
and lately i've been contemplating
escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me
it's making me crazy what's in my
you'll be coming out of mommy's stomach soon
i better do something quick if i'ma be able to support you
i can barely support me but as long as you're healthy
that's all that matters for the time being
but obviously assuming you will be
just thinking ahead ima make it if it kills me
lets see how far i can take it with this music
i'm getting sick of chasing this illusion ha
sorry for sloppy writing
the pen in my hand is shaking please excuse me
dads a little nervous but at the same time excited
if i use this same energy while i'm saying rhymes and write them
with the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm
as i'm using in this letter maybe they can feel me as i'm
trying to build these castles out of sand baby girl
for you to sit on the throne i got plans baby girl
welcome to mom and dads crazy world
love daddy mapleflavored kisses buttered pancakes and syrup
you got your momma's personality same eyes as i got
her beautiful smile but your ears are the same size as mine are
sorry for that a little minor mishap
but you'll grow into them baby i'm on the grind now
i'm doing little shows open mics allnighters at studios
while i'm tryna keep the lights on
why does it seem like i'm so close to this dream yet so far
i just keep steering i'ma turn into someone
i haven't the slightest clue what i'ma do if it falls through
you took your first steps today you'll probably walk soon
my infinite cd flopped too many soft tunes
they're talking bad about dad it's ticking me off too
makes me feel like i don't belong or something ooh
i think i might have just stumbled onto something new
got a prediction for the future i'm hoping that you
open this envelope when you're older and it holds true
now if you found these letters i guess i better try to explain
a lot's happened in between them since i rised to this fame
i've said your name but always tried to hide your face
this game is crazy i wanted to claim my love for you but dang
i never knew it'd be like this if i did i wouldn't have done it
you ain't asked for none of this shit now you're being punished
things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
i can't stomach they can take this fame back i don't want it
i'll put out this last album then i'm done with it
onehundred percent finished
fed up with it i'm hanging it up fuck it
excuse the cursing baby but just know
that i'm a good person though they portray me as cold
and if things should worsen don't take this letter i wrote
as a goodbye note but your dad's at the end of his rope
i'm sliding down a slippery slope
anyways sweetie i better go
i'm getting sleepy love dad shit i don't know
it's like i'm in this dirt digging up old hurt
tried everything to get my mind off you it won't work
all it takes is one song on the radio you're
right back on it reminding me all over again
how you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
spent a lot of time tryna soul search
maybe i needed to grow up a little first
well looks like i hit a growth spurt
but i'm coming for closure
don't suppose an explanation i'm owed for
the way that you turned your back on me
just when i may have needed you most
oh you thought it was over you could just close the
chapter and go about your life like it was nothing
you ruined mine but you seem to be doing fine
well i've never recovered
but tonight i bet you that what you're
'bout to go through's tougher than anything i ever have suffered
can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
can i hold grudges mind saying let it go fuck this
heart's saying i will once i bury this bitch alive
hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset
and to think i used to think you was the shit bitch
to think it was you at one time i worshipped shit
think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
not this time you better go and get the sewing kit bitch
finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew nitwit
thought some time would pass and i'd forget it forget it
you left our family in shambles
and you expect me to just get over him pretend he never existed
may be gone but he's not forgotten
and don't think cause he's been out the picture
so long that i've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to get ya
you're wrong and that shit was rotten
and the way you played him's same shit you did to me cold
have you any idea the shit that i've gone through
feelings i harbor all this pentup resentment i hold on to
not once you call to ask me how i'm doing
letters you don't respond to 'em
fuck it i'm coming to see you
and gee who better to talk to than you
the cause of my problems
my life is garbage and i'm 'bout to take it out on you
poof then i'm gone voosh
i've been driving around your side of this town
like 9 fricking hours and 45 minutes now
finally i found your new address park in your drive
feel like i've been waiting on this moment all of my life
and it's now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva
my knife is out and i'm ducking on the side of your house
see it's sad it came to this point
such a disappointment i had to make this appointment
to come and see ya but i ain't here for your empathy
i don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
it's revenge that i seek
so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
like i reach my full potentiali peeked
continue to peep still bent low then keep
tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak
all the way 'round to the back porch
man door handles unlocked shouldn't be that easy to do this
you don't plan for intruders beforehand
surprised to see me cat got your tongue
gag chloroform rag dag almost hackup a lung
like you picked an axe up and swung stick to the core plan
dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
irony's spectacular huh now who's a faggot you punk
and here's your bronco hat
you can have that shit back cause they suck
it's just me you and the music now slim i hope you hear it
we're in a car right now  wait here comes my favorite lyric
i'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
and hey here's a sequel to my
mathers lp just to try to get people to buy
how's this for a publicity stunt this should be fun
last album now cause after this you'll be officially done
eminem killed by m and m matthew mitchell
bitch i even have your initials
i initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
since you're in love with your city so much i figured what the fuck
the best place you could be buried alive is right here
two more exits time is quite near
hope we don't get stopped no license i fear
that sirens i hear guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
oh god police aaaghh
hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least
new plan stan
slim chauvinist pig drove in this big lincoln town car
well gotta go almost at the bridge
ha ha big bro it's for you slim this is for him
and frank ocean oh hope you can swim good
now say you hate homos again
part 2 produced by streetrunner
i also represent
anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
i'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
i'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
nope it's hopeless i'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
when they say all of this is approaching its end
but you refuse to believe that it's over here we go all over again
back's to the wall i'm stacking up all them odds
toilets clogged yeah cause i'm talking a lot of
shit but i'm backing it all up
but in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
after the track is demolished i am your lack of a conscience
i'm the ringing in your ears
i'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
eating your vocal cords after your concerts
i'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
grab for some water
but i'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
i'm the bullies you hate that you became
with every faggot you slaughtered
coming back on ya every woman you insult
batter but the doublestandard you have
when it comes to your daughters
i represent everything you take for granted
cause marshall mathers the rapper's persona
is half a facade and matthew and stan's just symbolic
of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
cause after all the glitz and the glam
no more fans that are calling your name
cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them
i'm the hindsight to say i told you so
foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
i'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
if you don't stop after they call ya
biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
when it's time to walk away i'm every guilt trip
the baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions
if there's anything you have left to say
'less it makes an impact then don't bother
so 'fore you rest your case
better make sure you're packing a wallop
so one last time i'm back
'fore it fades into black and it's all over
behold the final chapter in a saga
tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
twice the magic that started
it all tragic portrait of an artist
tortured trapped in his own drawings
tap into thoughts blacker and darker
than anything imaginable here goes a wild stab in the dark
uh as we pick up where the last mathers left off
my mother reproduced like the komodo dragon
and had me on the back of a motorcycle then crashed in
the side of locomotive with rap i'm
loco it's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
'bout to explode all over the canvas
back with the yoda of rap in a spasm
your music usually has 'em
but waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't
follow you must rick rubin my little padawan
a jedi in training colossal brain and
thoughts are entertainin'
but docile and impossible to explain and i'm also vain and
probably find a way to complain about a picasso painting
puke skywalker but sound like chewbacca when i talk
full of such blind rage i need a seein' eye dog
can't even find the page i was writing this rhyme on
oh it's on the rampage
couldn't see what i wrote i write small
it says ever since i drove a '79 lincoln with whitewalls
had a fire in my heart
and a dire desire to aspire to die hard
so as long as i'm on the clock punching this time card
hiphop ain't dying on my watch
no if he had
he wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
i wouldn't be so mad my attitude wouldn't be so bad
yeah dad i'm the epitome and the prime
example of what happens when the power of the rhyme
falls into the wrong hands and
makes you want to get up and start dancin'
even if it is charles manson
who just happens to be rappin' blue lights flashin'
laughin' all the way to the bank lampin' in my kmart mansion
im in the style department
with a pile in my cart rippin' the aisle apart but
with great power comes
absolutely no responsibility for content
completely despondent and condescending
the king of nonsense and controversy is on a
beatkilling spree your honor
i must plead guilty 'cause i sparked a revolution
rebel without a cause who caused the evolution
of rap to take it to the next level boost it
but several rebuked it and whoever produced it
hiphop is the devil's music
does that mean it belongs to me
'cause i just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
that don't honk but every time i speak you hear a beep
but lyrically i never hear a peep not even a whisper
rappers better stay clear of me bitch 'cause it's the
so yeah dadlet's walk
let's have us a fatherandson talk
but i bet we wouldn't probably get one block
without me knocking your block off this is all your fault
maybe that's why i'm so bananas i appealed to all those walks
of life whoever had strife
maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
'cause i related to the struggles of young america
when their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
now they're rippin' out their fuckin' hair again it's hysterical
i chuckle as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
yeah uhoh better beware knuckle heads
the sign of my hustle says
don't knock the door's broken it won't lock
it might just fly open get coldcocked
you critics come to pay me a visit
misery loves company please stay a minute
kryptonite to a hypocrite
zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
too busy gettin' stoned in your glass house
to kick rocks then you wonder why i lash out
mr mathers as advertised on the flyers so spread the word
'cause i'm promoting my passion until i'm passed out
completely braindead rain man
doing a bankhead in a restraint chair
so bitch shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
or get shanked in the pancreas
i'm angrier than all eight other reindeer
put together with chief keef 'cause i hate every fuckin' thang yeah
even this rhyme bitch
and quit tryin' look for a fuckin' reason for it that ain't there
but i still am a criminal
tenyearold degenerate grabbin' on my genitals
the last mathers lp done went diamond
this time i'm predicting this one will go emerald
when will the madness end
how can it when there's no method to the pad and pen
the only message that i have to send
is dad i'm back at it again
bitch where the fuck were you tuesday with who you say
i wasn't at the studio bitch what'd you do screw dre
you went there lookin' for me boo that excuse is too lame
keep playin' me you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg
you fake lyin' slut you never told me you knew drake
and lupe you wanna loose two legs
you tryin' to flip this on me if i spent more time with you you say
okay yeah and i'm coocoo eh  well screw you
and i'll be the third person who screwed you today
oh fourthdre drake lupeoohm touch
you were too twofaced for me
thought you was my number one trueblue ace
but you ain't and i can't see you when you make that wittle booboo face
'cause i'm hanging up this phone boo you make my fuckin' bluetooth ache
you're feeling blue too late go smurf yourself
you make me wanna smurf and puke blue kool aid
here's what you say to someone you hate
think i just relapsed this bitch pushed me over the brink
hop on the freeway tryna get some time alone and just think
'til the cops pulled me over but they let me go 'cause i told 'em
i'm only drivin' drunk 'cause that bitch drove me to drink
i'm back on my fuck hoes with a whole new hatred for blondes
but bias i hate all bitches the same baby come on
excuse the pun but bitch is such a broad statement and i'm
channelin' my anger through every single station that's on
'cause a woman broke my heart i say heart
'cause she ripped it in two paarts and threw it in the garbage
who do you think you aare bitch guess it's time for me to get the dust off
and pick myself up off the carpet
but i'll never say the lword again
i lolololo lesbian
aaahhh i hope you hear this song
and go into a cardiac arrest my life'd be so much better if you just
and i'ma have a whale of a time
bein' a single sailor for the night bitch on a scale of
one to ten shit i must be the holy grail of
catches ho i got an oscar attached to my fuckin' name de la
i might hit the club find a chick that's tailormade
for me say fuck it kick some shots back get hammered and nail her
these bitches tryin' to get attached but they're failin' to latch onto the tail of
my bumper they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer
like i'm itchin' to get hitched yeah i'm rich as a bitch
but bitches ain't shit i'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
bitch you complain when you listen to this
but you still throw yourself at me that's what i call pitchin' a bitch
that's why i'm swingin' at this chicks onsite
long as i got a bat and two balls it's foul but my dick's on strike
so all that love shit is null and void bitch i'm a droid
i avoid cupid stupid wasn't for blow jobs you'd be unemployed
oyeyoyyoy manohman your boyboyboy's
gettin' sick of these girlsgirlsgirls oinkoinkoink
you fuckin' pigs all you're good for is doinkdoinkdoink
i got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
she's all 99 of 'em i need a machine gun
i'll take 'em all out i hope you hear this song
and go into a cardiac arrest have a heart attack and just
drop dead and i'ma throw a fuckin' party after this 'cause yes
wasn't ready to be no millionaire i was illprepared
i was prepared to be ill though the skill was there
from the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends it was 'bout
bustin' raps and standin' for somethin' fuck an acronym
cut the fuckin' act like you're happy i'm fuckin' back again
with another anthem  why stop when it doesn't have to end
it ain't over 'til i say it's over enough when i say enough
throw me to them wolves and close the gate up i'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
into an alligator pit i salivate at it wait is up
hands up like it's 12 noon nah homie hold them bitches straighter up
wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
came up rough came to ruffle feathers nah egos i ain't deflate enough
last chance to make this whole stadium erupt 'cause
i can see the finish line with each line that i finish
i'm so close to my goals i can almost pole vault over the goal post
and if i don't got enough in the tank maybe i can just siphon enough
to fill up this last can man will i survive in this climate or what
they said i was washedup and got a bloodbath
i'm not a rapper i'm an adapter i can adjust
plus i can just walk up to a mic and just bust
so floor's open if you'd like to discuss
top 5 in this muh'fucka and if i don't make the cut
what like i give a fuck i'ma light this bitch up like i'm driving a truck
through the side of a pump 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
like gunit without the hyphen i'm hyping 'em up
and if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
and i look like i might just give up eh might've mistook
me for bowin' out i ain't takin' a bow i'm stabbin' myself
with a fuckin' knife in the gut while i'm wipin' my butt
'cause i just shitted on the mic and i like gettin' cut
i get excited at the sight of my blood you're in a fight with a nut
'cause i'ma fight 'til i die or win bitin' the dust
it'll just make me angrier wait let me remind you of what
got me this far picture me quittin'
now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut
it's survival of what
yeah so get your ideas stack your ammo
but don't come unless you come to battle now mount up jump in the saddle
this is itit's what you eat sleep piss and shit
live breathe your whole existence just consists of this
refuse to quit fuse is lit can't defuse the wick
if i don't do this music shit i'll lose my shit
ain't got shit to lose it's the moment of truth it's all i know how to do
as soon as i get thrown in a booth i spit
but my respect is overdue i'm showin' you the flow no one do
'cause i don't own no diploma for school i quit
so there's nothin' for me to fall back on i know no other trade
so you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some toolboxes
'cause you'll never take my pride from me it'll have to be pried from me
so pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
but i want you to doubt me i don't want you to buhlieve
'cause this is somethin' that i must use to succeed
and if you don't like me then fuck you selfesteem
must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof 'cause trust me
my skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
i can see why the fuck i disgust you i must be
allergic to failure 'cause everytime i come close to it
i just sneeze but i just go achoo then achieve
i used to be the type of kid
that would always think the sky is fallin'
why am i so differently wired am i a martian
what kind of twisted experiment am i involved in
cause i don't belong in this world
that's why i'm scoffin' at authority defiant often
flyin' off at the handle at my mom
no dad so i am noncompliant at home
at school i'm just shy and awkward
and i don't need no goddamn psychologist
tryna diagnose why i have all these underlyin' problems
thinkin' he can try and solve 'em
i'm outside chalkin' up drawings
on the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'
to myself either that or inside hidin' off in
the corner somewhere quiet tryin' not to
be noticed cause i'm cryin' and sobbin'
i had a bad day at school so i ain't talkin'
some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin' locker
cause he said that i eyeballed him
i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
why am i so differently wired in my noggin
cause sporadic as my thoughts come it's mindbogglin'
cause i obsess on everything in my mind small shit
bothers me but not my father he said sayonara
then split but i dont give a shit
i'm fine long as there's batteries in my walkman
nothing is the matter with me
shit look on the bright side at least i ain't walkin'
i bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
complex on a tenspeed which i've acquired parts that
i find in the garbage a frame then put tires on it
headphones on look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
but if this is all there is for me life offers
why bother even tryin' to put up a fight it's nonsense
but i think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
what about them rhymes i've been jottin'
they are kind of giving me confidence
instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
why don't i just blast a little something like onyx
to put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
say what i wanna say to the kid that said that i eyeballed him
grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
who woulda knew from the moment i turned the mic on that
i could be iconic in my conquest
that's word to phife dawg from a tribe called quest
i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
now i think the fact that i'm differently wired's awesome
cause if i wasn't i wouldn't be able to work words like this
and connect lines like crosswords
and use my enemy's words as strength
to try and draw from and get inspired off 'em
cause all my life i was told and taught i am not shit
by you wack fuckin' giant sacks of lyin' dog shit
now you shut up bitch i am talkin'
thought i was full of horseshit
and now you fuckin' worship the ground on which i am walkin'
me against the world so what i'm brian dawkins
versus the whole 016 lions offense
so bring on the giants falcons and miami dolphins
it's the body bag game bitch i'm supplyin' coffins
cause you dicks butt kiss bunch of brian baldingers
you're gon' die a balllicker i've been diabolical
with this dialogue since '99 rawkus
you don't respect the legacy i leave behind y'all can
suck a dick the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
in a flyin' saucer full of italian sausage
the most high exaltin' and i ain't haltin'
'til i die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
the best part about me is i am not you
i'm me and i'm the fire marshall and this is my
came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
an asshole that role i think i succeeded fulfillin'
but don't think i ever stopped
to think that i was speakin' to children
everything was happenin' so fast
it was like i blinkedsold three million
then it all went blank all i remember is feelin' ridiculous
cause i was gettin' sick of this feelin'
like i'm always under attack man
i could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
women dishin' but really thinkin' if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this i would kill him
guess i'm a little bit of a hypocrite when i'm rippin' shit
but since when did this many people ever give a shit
what i had to say it's just my opinion
if it contradicts how i'm livin' put a dick in your rear end
that's why every time you mentioned a lyric
i thanked you for it for drawin' more attention toward it
cause it gave me an enormous platform
i'm flattered you thought i was that important
but you can't ignore the fact that i fought for the respect
and battled for it mad awards had glaad annoyed
attaboy they told me to slow down i'd just zone out
good luck tryin' to convince a blonde
it's like tellin' gwen stefani she sold out
cause i was tryna leave no doubt
in anyone's mind one day i'd go down in history
think they know now because everybody knows
quit actin' salty i was countin' on you to count me out
ask asher roth when he roundabout
dissed me to shout me out
thought i was history well goddamn honky
that compliment's like backhandin' a donkey
good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
nah i'm off him
but what the fuck's all this trashtalkin' about
the fight was fixed i'm back and you can't stop me
you knocked me down i went down for the count
i fell but the fans caught me and now
you're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
to take my beltword to pacquiao
momma said there ain't nothin' else to talk about
better go in that ring and knock 'em out
or you better not come out
it's poetry in motion
like freddie roach when he's quotin' shakespeare
so what if insults are revoltin'
even helen keller knows life stinks
you think it's a joke 'til you're bulletriddled
but you should give little shit what i think
this whole world is a mess
gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest
and a glock just to go watch batman
who needs to test a testicles not that man
half of you don't got the guts intestinal blockage
rest of you got lap bands
stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts
and all those water bottles in colorado so get lost waldo
my soul's escapin' through this asshole that is gapin'
a black hole and i'm swallowin' this track whole
better pack toilet paper but i'm takin' no crap ho
here i go down the bat pole
and i'm changin' back into that old maniac
in fact there they go tryna dip out the back door retreatin'
cause everybody knows
holy mackerel i'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth
i smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
for thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
then screamed icp in this bitch how do fuckin' magnets work
cause you're attractive but we ain't attractable
hate to be dramatical but i'm not romantical
i'm makin' up words so you can understandable it's tragical
thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen that ain't practical
you crackin' a joke it's laughable
cause me and love's like a bad combination
i keep them feelings locked in a vault
so it's safe to say i'm uncrackable
my heart is truly guarded full body armor
bitch you just need a helmet
cause if you think you're special you're retarded
thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
you're a train wreck i got a onetrack mind
shorty you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er
cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
been tryna hunt me down like a dog
cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
cause all of my spare time is spent
on my nose in this binder so don't bother tryin'
only women that i love are my daughters
but sometimes i rhyme and it sounds like i forget i'm a father
and i push it farther
so father forgive me if i forget to draw the line
it's apparent i shouldn't have been a parent
i'll never grow up so to hell with your parents
and motherfuck father time
it ain't never gonna stop a pessimist
who transformed to an optimist in his prime
so even if i'm halfdead i'm halfalive
poured my halfempty glass in a cup
now my cup has runneth over
and i'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster
im goin' back to what got me here
yeah cocky and cant knock bein' rude off so fear not my dear
and dry up your teardrops i'm here
white america's mirror so don't feel awkward or weird
if you stare at me and see yourself because you're one too
shouldn't be a shock because everybody knows
now this shit's about to kick off this party looks wack
let's take it back to straight hiphop and start it from scratch
i'm 'bout to bloody this track up everybody get back
that's why my pen needs a pad 'cause my rhymes on the rag
just like i did with addiction i'm 'bout to kick it
like a magician critics i turn to crickets
got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
but quick to get it impaled when i tell 'em stick it
so sick i'm looking palewait that's my pigment
'bout to go ham ya bish shout out to kendrick
let's bring it back to that vintage slim bitch
the art of mcing mixed with da vinci and mc ren
and i don't mean stimpy's friend bitch
been public enemy since you thought pe was gym bitch
guess it's just the way that i'm dressed ain't it
khakis pressed nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
so i guess it ain't that aftershave
or cologne that made 'em just faint
plus i showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
so if love is a chess game check mate
but girl your body's bangin' jump me in dang bangbang
yes siree 'bob' i was thinking the same thang
so come get on this kid's rock baw with da baw dangdang
powppppow chica pow chica wowwow
got your gal blowin' up a valve vvvalvevalve
ain't slowin' it down throw in the towel tttoweltowel
dumb it down i don't know how huhhuh howhow
at least i know that i don't know
question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
hope so now ho
and they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
all i know is i fell asleep and woke up in that monte carlo
with the ugly kardashian lamar oh
sorry yowe done both set the bar low
far as hard drugs are though that's the past
but i done did enough codeine to knock future into tomorrow
and girl i ain't got no money to borrow
but i am tryin' to find a way to get you alone car note
oh marshall mathers
shithead with a potty mouth get the bar of soap lathered
kangol's and carheartless cargos
girl you're fixin' to get your heart broke
don't be absurd ma'am you birdbrain baby
i ain't called anybody baby since birdman unless you're a swallow haha
word rick word man you heard
but don't get discouraged girl
this is your jam unless you got toe jam
but for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
i got a laptop in my back pocket
my pen'll go off when i halfcock it
got a fat knot from that rap profit
made a livin' and a killin' off it
ever since bill clinton was still in office
with monica lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
i'm an mc still as honest
but as rude and as indecent as all hell
syllables skillaholic kill 'em all with
this flippity dippityhippity hiphop
you don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
with this rappity brat packin' a mac in the back of the ac'
backpack rap crap yapyap yacketyyack
and at the exact same time i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while i'm practicin' that
i'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
only realized it was ironic i was signed to aftermath after the fact
how could i not blow all i do is drop fbombs
feel my wrath of attack
rappers are havin' a rough time period here's a maxi pad
it's actually disastrously bad for the wack
while i'm masterfully constructing this masterpice
well to be truthful the blueprint's
simply rage and youthful exuberance
everybody loves to root for a nuisance
hit the earth like an asteroid
did nothing but shoot for the moon since pew
mcs get taken to school with this music
'cause i use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme
now i lead a new school full of students
me i'm a product of rakim
lakim shabazz 2pac nwa cube hey doc ren
yella eazy thank you they got slim
inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position
to meet rundmc induct them
into the motherfuckin' rock and roll hall of fame
even though i'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
only hall of fame i'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
on the wall of shame
you fags think it's all a game 'til i walk a flock of flames
off a plank and tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'
little gaylookin' boy
so gay i can barely say it with a straight face lookin' boy haha
you're witnessin' a massoccur
like you're watching a church gathering take place lookin' boy
oy vey that boy's gaythat's all they say lookin' boy
you get a thumbs up pat on the back
and a way to go from your label every day lookin' boy
hey lookin' boy what you say lookin' boy
i get a hell yeah from dre lookin' boy
i'ma work for everything i have never asked nobody for shit
get outta my face lookin' boy
basically boy you're never gonna be capable
of keepin' up with the same pace lookin' boy 'cause
so you'll be thor and i'll be odin
you rodent i'm omnipotent
let off then i'm reloadin'
immediately with these bombs i'm totin'
and i should not be woken
i'm the walkin' dead but i'm just a talkin' head a zombie floatin'
but i got your mom deepthroatin'
i'm out my ramen noodle
we have nothin' in common poodle
i'm a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil
it's me my honesty's brutal
but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though
for good at least once in a while
so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes
to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
but i gotta keep a few punchlines
just in case 'cause even you unsigned
rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
i know there was a time where once i
was king of the underground
but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind
so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine
appeal with the skin color of mine
you get too big and here they come tryin'
to censor you like that one line
i said on i'm back from the mathers lp 1 when i
tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine
put 'em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9
see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was but i'm
morphin' into an immortal comin' through the portal
you're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
you're pointless as rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
you write normal fuck being normal
and i just bought a new raygun from the future
just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad
'cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad
singin' to a man while he played piano
man oh man that was a 247 special on the cable channel
so ray j went straight to the radio station
the very next day hey fab i'ma kill you
lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed jj fad
uh summalumma doomalumma you assumin' i'm a human
what i gotta do to get it through to you i'm superhuman
innovative and i'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
i'm devastating more than ever demonstrating
how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting
for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating
'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated
i make elevating music you make elevator music
oh he's too mainstream
well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it
it's not hiphop it's pop'cause i found a hella way to fuse it
with rock shock rap with doc
throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it
i don't know how to make songs like that
i don't know what words to use
let me know when it occurs to you
while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurtin' you
how many verses i gotta murder to
prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too
ugh school flunky pill junkie
but look at the accolades these skills brung me
full of myself but still hungry
i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to
and i'm a million leagues above you
ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongueincheek fuck you
i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel
i'ma sleep in the front seat
bumpin' heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky
but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling
angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
i have then you may be a little patient
and more sympathetic to the situation
and understand the discrimination
but fuck it life's handin' you lemons make lemonade then
but if i can't batter the women
how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then
don't mistake him for satan it's a fatal mistake
if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation
to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and
don't be a retardbe a king think not
why be a king when you can be a god
i walk around like a space cadet place your bets
who's likely to become a serial killer case of tourettes
fuck fuckfuck can't take the stress
i make a mess as the day progresses
angry and take it out on the neighbors' hedges
like this is how i'll cut your face up bitches with these hedgetrimmin' scissors with razor edges
imagination's dangerous it's the only way to escape this mess
and make the best of this situation i guess
'cause i feel like a little bitch this predicament's
despicable i'm sick of just gettin' pushed it's ridiculous
i look like a frickin' wuss a pussy this kid just took
my stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
i wanna kick his tush but i was six and shook
this fucker was 12 and was six foot with a vicious hook
he hit me i fell i got back up all i did was book
now there's usin' your head momma always said
fast forward some years later a teenager this is fun sweet
i just got jumped twice in one week it's complete
it's usually once a month this is some feat i've accomplished
they've stomped me into the mud gee for what reason you stumped me
but how do you get the shit beat out of you beat down
and be upbeat when you don't have nothing
no valid shot at life chance to make it or succeed
'cause you're doomed from the start it's like you grew up on jump street from jump street
but if i could just get my head out my ass
i could accomplish any task practicin' trashtalkin' in a trance
locked in my room yeah but i got some plans momma
these damn rhymes are fallin' out of my pants pocket i can't stop it
and i'm startin' to blend in more in school this shit helps for sure
i'm gettin' more selfassured than i've ever been before
plus no one picks on me anymore
i done put a stop to that threw my first punchend of story
still in my skulls a vacant empty void been usin' it more as a bin for storage
take some inventory in this gourd there's a ford engine
door hinge syringe an orange an extension cord and a ninja sword
not to mention four linchpins an astringent stored
ironin' board a bench a wrench a ore winch an attention whore
everything but a brain but dome's off the fuckin' chain
like an independent store something's wrong with my
head just think if i had a brain in it thank god that i
don't 'cause i'd probably be dahmer 'cause momma always said
i told you one day i said they'd have that red carpet rolled out yo
i'm nice y'all fuck it i'm out cold now everywhere i go
they scream out go i'm 'bout to clean house yo
i'm lysol now i'm just household
outsold the sellouts freak the hell out middle america
hear 'em yell out in terror they were so scared and those kids
just about belted out whatever spouted
or fell out my smart aleck mouth it was so weird
inappropriate so be it i don't see it
maybe one day when the smoke clears it won't be as
motherfuckin' difficult yeah
'til then hopefully you little homos get over your fears and phobias
it's okay to be scared straight they said i provoke queers
'til emotions evoke tears my whole career's
a stroke of sheer genius smoke and mirrors tactical practical jokes yeah
you motherfuckin' insert insult here
who the fuck woulda thunk that one little ole mc'd
be able to take the whole culture and reupholster it
and boy they did flock can't believe this little hick locked
this hiphop shit in his hip pocket and still the shit got
that whitetrash traffic in gridlock shit hoppin' like six blocks
from a kid rockinsane clown posse concert in midoc
tober and god forbid i see a wizard
and get a brain in my titanium cranium y'all
'cause i'll turn into the unabomber momma always said
you used to say that i'd never be
nothin' without you and i'd believe
i'm shot in the lungs i gasp i can't breathe
just lay here with me baby hold me please
and i'd beg and i'd plead drop to knees
and i'd cry and i'd scream baby please don't leave
snatch the keys from your hand i would squeeze
and you'd laugh and you'd tease
you're just fucking with me and you must hate me
why do you date me if you say i make you sick
and you've had enough of me
i smother you i'm 'bout to jump off the edge
a beautiful face is all that you have
cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
but you're all that i love i grasp you can't leave
please stay here with me baby hold me please
and i'd beg and i'd plead drop to knees
and i'd cry and i'd scream baby please don't leave
but you left and you took everything i had left
and left nothin' nothin' for me
so please don't wake me from this dream baby
we're still together in my head
and you're still in love with me
'til i woke up to discover that that dream was dead
you walked out i almost died
it was almost a homicide
that you caused cause i was so traumatized
felt like i was in for a long bus ride
i'd rather die than you not be by my side
can't count how many times i vomited cried
go to my room turn the radio on and hide
thought we were bonnie and clyde
nah on the inside you were jekyll and hyde
i felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
it was you and i why did i think it was ride or die
cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
it's like you put a knife through my chest
and pushed it right through to the
other side of my back and stuck a spike too shoulda
put up more of a fight but i couldn't
at the time no one could hurt me like you coulda
take you back now what's the likelihood of that
bite me bitch chew on a nineteen footer
cause this morning i finally stood up
held my chin up finally showed a sign of life in me for the
first time since you left
and left me with nothin' but shattered dreams
and the life we coulda had and we coulda been
but i'm breakin' out of this slump i'm in
pullin' myself out of the dumps once again
i'm gettin' up once and for allfuck this shit
i'ma be late for the pity party
but you're never gonna beat me to the fuckin' punch again
took it on the chin like a champ

in a public stall droppin' a football
so every time someone walks in the john i get maddened
shady what up what come on man i'm crappin'

told him todd you're the shit when's all of this crap end
can't pump my gas without causin' an accident
pump my gas cut my grass i can't take out the fuckin' trash
without someone passin' through my sub harassin'
i'd count my blessings but i suck at math

mozzarella on my spaghetti

they say this spray butter's bad for my health but
i think this poor white trash from the trailer
jed clampett fred sanford and welfare
mentality helps to keep me grounded
that's why i never take full advantage of wealth i
managed to dwell within these parameters
still crammin' the shelves full of hamburger helper
i can't even help it this is the hand i was dealt a
creature of habit feel like i'm trapped in an animal shelter
with all these pet peeves goddamn it to hell i
can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
i can't go anywhere i get so mad i could yell the
other day someone got all elaborate
and stuck a head from a fuckin' dead cat in my mailbox
went to burger kingthey spit on my onion rings
i think my karma's catchin' up with me
i'm tryin' to be lowkey hopefully nobody notices me
in produce hunched over giant nosebleed
ogre style as i mosey over to the frozen aisle
by the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
embarrassed i just did comerica with hova

they want me to flip at the label but i won't succumb to it
the pressure they want me to follow up with
another one after recovery was so highly coveted
but what good is a fuckin' recovery if i fumble it
'cause i'ma drop the ball if i don't get a grip
hoppin' out shrubbery on you sons of bitches
wrong subdivision to fuck with bitch
quit snappin' fuckin' pictures of my kids
i love my city but you pushed me to the limitwhat a pity
the shit i complain about
it's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's rainin' out
koolaid stain on the couch i'll never get it out
but bitch i got an elevator in my house
ants and a mousei'm livin' the dream
something's burnin' i can't figure out what out what
it's either lust or a cloud of dust
judgement is clouded must
just be the powder from the power of love
but i'm in something i don't know how to get out of
left my girl in the house alone
is that my soontobespouses moan
and the further i walk the louder
pause for a minute to make certain that's what i heard
cause after all this is her place
so i give her the benefit of the doubt i
think i might be about to bust her bust her
the thought's scary yo though and it hurtsbrace
hope it ain't here we go yo
cause my head already goes to worstcase
scenario though in the first place ah fuck
but you confirmed my lowend theory though
should've known when i made it all the way to third base
and that was only the first date
could've made it to home plate
but you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
no slurp you don't slurp under slurp stand slurp
i slurp don't slurp do this for hic anyone hic ever slurp
yeah that ain't what they all say
i'll say you can suck a softball through a straw

'til you sucked on wayne andr and kanye
lebron akon jay lil jon raekwon mae
polow da don dre dante ross james conway kwam

i told that bitch i'm a sucker for love you a sucker for dick
suckin' dick in your mama tub then your granny walked in

i'm in the mirror with this look on my face curious
why you ain't fuckin' with me you cut me deep as caesarean
you know i want you bad as a benjamin i'm delirious
i want you bad as the head shattered on george zimmerman
after the dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
his mouthpiece for a cadillac emblem
that's analogy and metaphor for you
i should win a medal for all the ways i adore you
this is me talkin' cordial yeah i got some home training
that ain't what you like ain't it
what about if i was as famous as marshall
would you give fellatio in the carpool
cops pull us over they just wanna know if you gargle
singin' i hope she's good enough
meanwhile you're chasin' her
chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
pity the fool and pity the fool in me i'ma live with the
so needless to say i'm feelin' betrayed
snatch my house key off her key chain
she jumps off weebey from the wire's dick
now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
here goes that broken record clich
it's all my fault anyway she's turnin' the tables i'm a beatbreak
she treats my face like serato she cuts and scratches like a dj
each day is an instant replay
they say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
back together but forgot today was her bday
she cut me off on the freeway
simple misunderstanding but just as i went to slam on the brakes
that's when i realized that she may be crazy as me wait
bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
stepped on them fuckers eight times
still goin' seventythree thank god there's an exit comin' up
what the motherfuck's wrong with her
hit the off ramp 'til i coasted to a goshdamn halt
hit a fuckin' tree now here she comes at full speed
she's racin' at me okay you wanna fuck with me eh
snatch that bitch out her car through the window
she screamin' i body slam her on the cement
until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
buried the stink ho in it then paid to have the street repaved
the fuck woke up in a dream state
in a cold sweat like i got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
guess i eventually caved though cause she's layin' next to me in beddirectly aimin' a gat at my head
woke up again and jumped up
like fuck it i've had it i'm checkin' into rehab
i confess i'm a static addict i guess that's why i'm so clingy
every girl i've ever had either says i got too much baggage
or i'm too fuckin' dramatic
man what the fuck is the matter i'm just a fuckin' romantic
i fuckin' love you you fuckin' bitch
combative possessive in fact last time i was mad at an ex
i actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
i said hit the road then after she left
i sent that bitch a text that said be careful driving
don't read this and have an accident
she glanced to look at it and wrecked car crashes
too bad thought we had a connect
no sense dwelling makes never been a more compelling case
than the model covered in l'oral and mace
who fell from grace eleven stories for storytellin'
while the whore was yellin' rape
'til her vocal cords were swellin'
and her voice were more hoarser than tori spellings' face
still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates
to greet norman bates with a warm embrace
'less you're andrea yates don't ask me for a date though
you're late well the sentiment's great
but wait think there's been a mistake
you wanted an intimate date i wanna intimidate
i have infinite hate in my blood
it's mainly 'cause of the game of message sound
wait dinner at eight i have infinite hate in my blood
it's mainly 'cause of the
i went in headfirst never thinkin' about who what i said hurt
in what verse my mom probably got it the worst
the brunt of it but as stubborn as we are did i take it too far
cleanin' out my closet and all them other songs
but regardless i don't hate you cause ma
you're still beautiful to me cause you're my mom
though far be it from you to be calm
our house was vietnam desert storm
and both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
equivalent to chemical warfare
and forever we could drag this on and on
but agree to disagree that gift for me
up under the christmas tree don't mean shit to me
you're kickin' me out it's 15 degrees
and it's christmas eve little prick just leave
ma let me grab my fucking coat
anything to have each other's goats
why we always at each other's throats
especially when dad he fucked us both
we're in the same fuckin' boat
you'd think that'd make us close nope
further away it drove us but together headlights shine
and a car full of belongings still got a ways to go
back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
and i was the man of the house the oldest
so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
then nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
and that's when i realized you were sick
and it wasn't fixable or changeable
and to this day we remain estranged and i hate it though but
cause to this day we remain estranged and i hate it though
cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
but i'm sorry momma for cleanin' out my closet
at the time i was angry rightfully maybe so
never meant that far to take it though
cause now i know it's not your fault and i'm not makin' jokes
that song i no longer play at shows
and i cringe every time it's on the radio
and i think of nathan being placed in a home
and all the medicine you fed us and
how i just wanted you to taste your own
but now the medication's takin' over
and your mental state's deterioratin' slow
and i'm way too old to cry this shit is painful though
but ma i forgive you so does nathan yo
all you did all you said you did your best to raise us both
foster care that cross you bear few may be as heavy as yours
but i love you debbie mathers
oh what a tangled web we have cause
one thing i never asked was
where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
fuck it i guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
but i'da flipped every mattress every rock and desert cactus
owned a collection of maps
and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
if someone ever moved 'em from me
that you coulda bet your asses
if i had to come down the chimney dressed as santa kidnap 'em
and although one has only met their grandma once
you pulled up in our drive one night
as we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
me her and nate we introduced you hugged you
and as you left i had this overwhelming sadness
come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
i saw your headlights as i looked back
and i'm mad i didn't get the chance to
thank you for being my mom and my dad
so mom please accept this as a
tribute i wrote this on the jet i guess i had to
get this off my chest i hope i get the chance to
lay it 'fore i'm dead the stewardess said to fasten
my seatbelt i guess we're crashin'
so if i'm not dreamin' i hope you get this message that
i will always love you from afar cause you're my mom
i'm in a strange place
i feel like mae when he gave up the game for his faith
i feel like i'm caged in these chains and restraints
grimmin' every stranger in the place while i gaze into space
cause i'm mentally rearrangin' his face
i need a change of pace
cause the pace i'm workin' at's dangerous
there's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
i done quit chicken heads cold turkey
and started slowly roastin' 'em
cause that's where most of my anger is based
fuck your feelings
i feel like i play for the saints
i just wanna hurt youaim for the skanks
then aim for all these fake kanyes jays waynes and the drakes
i'm frustrated cause ain't no more n'sync now i'm all out of whack
i'm all out of backstreet boys to call out and attack
i'm goin' all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is i'm strapped for battle
suck a duck crawl out the backit's a bar fight
prepare your arsenal
and beware of bar stools flyin' through the air and bottles breakin' mirrors also
and i ain't stoppin' 'til the swear jar's full
you done called every woman a slut but you're forgetting sarah marshall palin
oh my bad slut and next time i show up to court
i'll be naked and just wear a law suit
judge be like that's sharp
how much that motherfucker cost you smartass
you're lucky i don't tear it off you
and jump your bones you sexy motherfucker
you're so fuckin' gravy marshall i should start callin' you 'au jus'
cause all's you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo
evil twin take this beat now it's all you
i believe people can change but only for the worse
i coulda changed the world if it wasn't for this verseso satanic
kmart chains panic cause they can't even spin back the curse words
cause they're worse when they're reversed motherfucker
rekcufrehtom rape your mother tihs kill your parents
and these kids are like parrots
they run around the house just like terrorists
screamin' fuck shit fuck
adult with a childishlike arrogance
wild ever since the day i came out i was like merits
fuck that i'd rather be loud and i like swearin'
from the first album even the gals were like tight lyrics dreamy eyes
but my fuckin' mouth was nightmarish
and from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and opposition felt the opposite
sometimes i listen and revisit them old albums often as i can and skim through all them bitches to make sure i keep up with my competition haha
hogger of beats hoarder of rhymes
borderline genius who's bored of his lines
and that sort of defines where i'm at and the way i feel now
feel like i might just strike first then ignore the replies
so who's left lady gaga mess with the bieber
nah f with christina
i ain't fuckin' with either jessica neither simpson or alba
my album's just sicker than strep with the fever
get the chloraseptic excedrin aleve or
extra strength tylenol 3s
feel like i'm burnin' to death but i'm freezin'
bedridden and destined never to leave the
bedroom ever again like the legend of heathuh
ledger
my suicide note's barely legible read the
bottom it's signed by the joker
lorena said i never can leave her
she'll sever my wiener i ever deceive her
fuck that shit bitch give up my dick for pussy
i'll be jerry mathers i ever left it to beaver
get them titties cut off tryna mess with a cleaver
golly wolly i vent heat register jesus
ever since 19946 dresden it was definitely in my destiny
when on the steps i met deshaun at osborn
i'd never make it to sophomore
i just wanted to skip school and rap
used to mop floors flip burgers and wash dishes
while i wrote rhymes tryna get props for 'em
cause i took book smarts and swapped for 'em
they were sleepin' i made 'em stop snorin'
made 'em break out the popcorn
now i've been hip hop in its tiptop form
since nwa was blarin' through my car windows
leanin' on the horn screamin' fuck the police like cop porn
flipped rap on its ear like i dropped corn
fuck top five bitch i'm top four
and that includes biggie and pac whore
and i got an evil twin
so who the fuck you think that third and that fourth spot's for
and crazy as i am i'm much tamer than him and i'm nuts
then again who the fuck wants a plain eminem
but no one's insaner than slim look at that evil grin
evil twin please come in what was your name again
hi faggot
look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
two rabbits a koala bear and a ball of hair
and you're all aware i don't got it all upstairs
guess that's why i'm an addict and it's so small up there
peace to whitney
jeez just hit me
that i should call the looney police to come get me
cause i'm so sick of bein' the truth
i wish someone'd finally admit me
to a mental hospital with britney
oh lmfao no way jo
se baez couldn't beat this rapoj no
hooray i'm off the hook like casey anthony hey ho hey ho
i sound like i'm tryna sing the fuckin' chorus to hip hop hooray

and i base whether we're fuckin' off that instead of your face so
let your lowend raise yo
tango what you think ho slow dancin' or bowling
you tryin' to hold hands with your homie
what you think i'm lookin' for romance cause i'm lonely
change that tune you ain't got a remote chance to control me
ho i'm only vulnerable when i got a boner
superman try to fuck me over it won't hurt
don't try to fix me i'm broke so i don't work
so are you but you're broke cause you don't work
but all bullshit aside i hit a stride
still shady inside hair every bit as dyed
as it used to be when i first introduced y'all to my skittish side
and blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
cause we are the same
bitch
i wanted the fame but not the cover of newsweek
oh well guess beggars can't be choosey
wanted to receive attention for my music
wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
for wantin' my cake and eat it too and wantin' it both ways
fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
when i blew see but it was confusing
'cause all i wanted to do's be the bruce lee of loose leaf
abused ink used it as a tool when i blew steam
whoo hit the lottery oohwee
but with what i gave up to get it was bittersweet
it was like winnin' a used mink
ironic 'cause i think i'm gettin' so huge i need a shrink
i'm beginnin' to lose sleep one sheep two sheep
goin' coocoo and kooky as kool keith
but i'm actually weirder than you think 'cause i'm
now i ain't much of a poet
but i know somebody once told me to seize the moment
and don't squander it 'cause you never know when it all
could be over tomorrow so i keep conjurin'
sometimes i wonder where these thoughts spawn from
yeah ponderin'll do you wonders
no wonder you're losin' your mind the way it wanders
yodelodelayheehoo i think it went wanderin' off down yonder
and stumbled onto jeff vanvonderen
'cause i need an interventionist
to intervene between me and this monster
and save me from myself and all this conflict
'cause the very thing that i love's killin' me and i can't conquer it
my ocd's conkin' me in the head keep knockin'
nobody's home i'm sleepwalkin'
i'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
don't shoot the messenger i'm just friends with the
call me crazy but i have this vision one day that
i'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
but until then drums get killed and
i'm comin' straight at mc's blood gets spilled and
i'll take you back to the days that i'd get on a dre track
give every kid who got played that pumpedup feelin'
and shit to say back to the kids who played him
i ain't here to save the fuckin' children
but if one kid out of a hundred million
who are goin' through a struggle feels it and relates that's great
it's payback russell wilson fallin' way back
in the draft turn nothin' into somethin' still can make that
straw into gold chump i will spinrumpelstiltskin in a haystack
maybe i need a straightjacket
face facts i am nuts for real but i'm okay with that
it's nothin' i'm still friends with the
you done witnessed unexplainable shit
too insane to explain people run from what they just don't get
maybe shady should have just hit 'em with a little bit
did i spit too soon should i have spoon fed 'em it
but i was just so eager to prove i was even
worth bein' in the same league or the room
of the people of whom i was in
every now and then i look up like i was seekin' approval
was it because of the pigment of my skin
or was it a figment of my imagination
maybe it bothered me more than it did them
maybe it wasn't a big deal back then
but to me it was see what it was
was i had developed a complex from being judged
proof spit his verse now i'm next let's see who balks
i'm in the booth staring back to see whose mugs
i get a reaction from usually the first thumb
was from proof and the rest of the crew backed him up
and no one lied to each other 'cause none of us had deals
it was real we just wanted tickets for that meal
ever since my mother was pregnant with a second egg
'cause she said that i had a baby sister
who fell out of the window i was too young to remember
kansas city projects i was like fivesix
and how come i remember malcolm isaac and boogy
if it was the projects in missouri
'cause those were my best friends until isaac
took my tricycle and my uncle todd went to try to go get it back
and ended up gettin' jumped and cut in the gut
with a switch and seventysome stitches
which is to this day why my mother still tries to show me some old fake picture
of a fictitious little sister who never existed
and this is why a part of my life's so twisted
but i can never be as sick as that bitch is
and by the way that picture's one of my relatives
you probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain
to see why everything i say is so insane
what's different about my brain
that separates me from other players in this game
on the surface it may seem like a scheme
or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy
but that's the last thing i need
is for people to walk around feelin' sorry for me
and i am not a g never claimed to be
i gave my vest to cashis just hope he don't need it more than me
but we'll see 'cause we ain't lookin' for beef
but if it comes our way what do we turn the other cheek come on
holy toledo its angelina jolie amigo
she told me yo shady just hand your penis to me ill deep throat
and brad if you try to stand between us then were gonna see bro
who was a fantasy i dont mean to damage your ego

and rope it shut with a lasso
couple of crushed lexapro broken up with the capsule or paxil

now im gone get the rectal thermometer get the lubra
cation and get the patient some darvocet to chew 'cause
with the soul of a shaman
i'll eat a beat then vomit
like a bulimic woman with an uneasy stomach
i pass by people on the street they seem like sheep and zombies
stiffer than a therapeutic pair of jeans you run in
so can you hear me coming
eminem this beat is absolutely disgusting
its probably got diseases on it
im just being honest i can see the comments
i can see the evolution as we creep up on it
i put that music in your veins like a needle junkie
shit i just do this for the haters i don't need the money
i'm diarrhea on the track so it needs plunging
somebody please tell these girls to release my undies
nobody really understands my language
i find it complicated just to hold a conversation
but still i got a whole lot of patience
sittin back watching earth from my space station

and i ain't looking back in fact they can stare at my ass crack
how's that for hind sight what the track say
they ask me am i okay they ask me if i'm happy
are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me
or am i just a little snappy and they genuinely care
doody most of my life it's just been me and you there
and i continuously stare at pictures of you
i never got to say i love you as much as i wanted to but i do
yeah i say it now when you can't hear me
what the fuck good does that do me now
but somehow i know you're near me in presence
oh i went and dropped some presents off for easter
to them two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their
minds a little and dog you'll never believe this
but sharonda actually talks to me nowjesus
and everyone else is just tryin' to pick up the pieces
man how could you touch so many fuckin' lives and just leave us
they say grievance has a way of affectin' everyone different
if it's true how the fuck i'm s'posed to get over you
difficult as it sounds
doody that's what we'd call each other
i don't know where it came from
but it just stuck with us we was always brothers
never thought about each other's skin colors
'til one day we was walkin' up the block in the summer
it was like 90 degrees i was catchin' a sunburn
tryin' to walk under the trees just to give me some comfort
i'm moanin' i just wanna get home and
i look over and your shirt is off
i'm like you're gonna fry you're like no i won't
i'm black stupid and black people they got melatonin
in their skinwe dont burn meanwhile my face is glowin'
and i feel like i'm on fire
and the entire time you're just laughin' at me
and snappin' at me with your shirt bastard
and i still have to get you back for that shit
and by the way them playboy rings my mother stole from you
well nate finally got 'em back shit
it must've been at least 16 years ago
well i put 'em in your caskoww
movin' past it it still ain't registered yet
but you can bet your legacy they'll never forget
the motor city motown hip hop vet
hip hop shop dreads it don't stop there
yeah as difficult as it sounds
and this might sound a little strange but i'ma tell it
i found that jacket that you left at my wedding
and i picked it up to smell it
i wrapped it up in plastic until i put it in glass
and hang up in the hallway so i can always look at it
and as for all me and d12 we feel like fuck rap
it feels like our general just fuckin' died in our lap
we shut off all our pagers all our cell numbers is changed
our twoways are in the trash
so some cats will have to find a new way
and i know it feels like the dreams will die with you today
but the truth is they're all still here and you ain't
purple gang you gotta keep pressin' on
don't ever give up the dream dog i got love for you all
and doody it's true you brought people together
who never woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
you were the peacemaker doody
i know sometimes you were moody
but you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding
but you was down for yours whenever it came to scrappin'
if it had to happen it had to happen
believe me i know you're the one who taught me to throw them 'bows back on dresden
from eggin' cars to paintballin' gettin' arrested
to sittin' across from each other in cells laughin' and jestin'
they tried to hit us for five years for that no question
i guess them hookers and bums that we shot up didn't show up for court so we got off on a technicality left sweatin'
me you and what's his face i forgot his fuckin' name
shame he even came to your funeral he betrayed our team
and if i see him again i'ma punch him in the fuckin' face
and thats on hailie jade whitney laine and alainas name
i let the pistol bang once just to lick a shot
in the air for you and pour some liquor out
with obie in the parking lot of 54 just before
we were supposed to get in cars to come and see you once more
difficult as it sounds
obie the person that came up introverted
'cause of nervousness that was solely the only verdict
it was worth it 'cause he changed became so observant
servin' such of a purpose
if you knew him earlier in his days it's like a different version
so much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
that's why it's curtains in this murder if you get him worked up
i'm so assertive on these muthafuckas acting tougher
had enough of isolatin' myself in a room
writing poems and songs doing the same in school
now look what he became a fool
'cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you
livin' hard but still julliard
a god walks and ain't spend a day in the pew
regardless of this i draw visual pictures when a nigga vents
so welcome to the art department
i stimulate the brain mimic emulate the sane
cynics keep on thinkin' it's a fuckin' gimmick when it ain't
clinically insane brain is on venus up uranus
label me a genius if you ever seen us you would say
he may seem as though he's plain normal if you ever meet him
greet him with a shake see he ain't as mean as what they say
see the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say
so he's vague so they mistake him for bein' crazed
you part ways your impression of him changed
you don't think he's strange you turn around and tell him peace and thanks
you catch him flippin' you off with his pants down
hands around his scrotum tuckin' his fuckin' penis between his legs
obie the person that came up introverted
'cause of nervousness that was solely the only verdict
it was worth it 'cause he changed became so observant
servin' such of a purpose
if you knew him earlier in his days it's like a different version
so much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
that's why it's curtains in this murder if you get him worked up
i'm so assertive on these muthafuckas acting tougher
had enough of isolating myself in a room
writing poems and songs doing the same in school
now look what he became a fool
'cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you
livin' hard but still julliard
a god walks and ain't spend a day in the pew
regardless of this i draw visual pictures when a nigga vents
so welcome to the art department
it's all psychologic why am i so maniacal
am i a psycho or some kind of psychotic shtick
or am i truly psychotic or my molecules just diabolical
'cause biologically i defy logic by golly haul me off on a trolley
probably want a quack or i'm back on that whacky tobacca
i'ma step away from crack obie smacked the shit out of me

and i ain't talkin giovannis on the wheels
so let me see you mommies get ya tail feathers kicking
im here to cock block like a square male chicken come on
we 'bout to get into a tale of a gunner that details the dungeon
just as the pale moon illuminates the hail and thunderin'
'01's the year where i fell from blunderin'
shady lifted his wing then i fell from under it
now im freefallin my career is gone into recalling
regardless of whos fault i was speedballin'
god bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the earth
then marshall doubled back and got me from on top of the hearse
im alive nigga justin t aint got nothin' on me
'cause i done cried mary j blige rivers
i realized that gods with us soon as i decided
to put that bottle down and pick up my todd bridges
the writing's on the wall
since niggas seen me at the baseball game
with shady and jayz suddenly everybody calls
like im just checking on you dog
while i throw up this message on the stall
your body language is sayin your confidence is gone
well pick ya ass up lil' homie come on
you just gon' sit there and take it or make 'em suck it
tell 'em where to shove it straight up
you gon' make love to the world or you gon' fuck it
the last time that life kicked me in the ass
i pulled down its pants and put a foot up its ass
man what a catastrophe itd be for me to be a bitchass pussy
and not open a can of whoopass let you pissants whoop me
will be the day i say i ate poop shit the day that
i don't straight shoot i'll drop outta my antiwomen hate group
say im a sissy faggot record it play it back
and put it on straight loop you haters look like you ate a grape fruit
to see me climbing back on that wagon got my swagger back
i was dragging hopped back on it grab the reigns on that bastard
and came back on 'em without remorse man
man of course im a onetrick pony
'cause ill be screaming on these whores 'til im hoarse
nah i ain't fading yet id rather stay and rap
i might've made a debt but i find excitement in wondering what ima write next so i don't stay in debt
me broke you might as well cut the embryo
out of my momma and play catch
with the baby with aks with baby bayonets
ima get rich or ima die trying
that's why it's either kill or be killed
so call me suicide homicide ryan
there's a bomb inside my head im a live wire
i am on the edge teetering on it like a totter i might
get on a nut like a tire iron i have no desire stopping
so why would i drop and roll that's how much on fire i am
rappers are fun and im the time 'cause im just flying by em
man im laughing at em the entire time why am i up
'cause tribulations i have triumphed bitch im fired up
so one time for me just let your fuckin' lighters light the sky up
this is a beat with no words at first its a blank painting
exercising the mind its brain strength training
it starts off something like shady's an insane maniac
yeah slim shady that's a zany name ain't it
now all you need's an image to go with the name baby
wifebeaters and white tshirts hanes mainly
it's a long shot but is it possible there's a lane maybe
if not he's gon' have to come and change the whole game ain't he
he wants the fame so bad he can taste it he can see his name up in lights
women screaming his fucking name fainting
shady did it he sold out the whole dang stadium
joe shmoe made it he took his plain jane lady
and his baby hailie out the trailer but he ain't trailing anymore
he's ahead of the race while maintaining his innocence
little does he know his train is derailing
and he's about to be raped by this game anally now
youre operating on all cylinders syllables spit like dillingers
spilling your guts people are feeling your mic skills
but these haters are ice grilling ya
willing to sacrifice anything for the life that they might steal from ya
fake friends will kill for ya die for ya but you cant decipher
why for the life of ya it wasnt like this when you were cyphering
argue with your wife again she found vicodin
in your pants last night again your dispute's public
nothing is private anymore oh and your best friend
say byebye to him what kind of apple you take a bite of slim
but this is what you wanted marshall ain't it fuck no
the way that it turned out was nothin' like the picture that i painted
in my head sometimes a dream and making it's more fun
than it's to actually make it the game stripped me naked
it robbed me of ever having another real relationship
with another girl this world is a fucking trip
as i slip in another world proceed take another hit
sniff 'til i fucking hurl tell 'em all to fucking sit
and spin 'til they fucking twirl middle finger up again
relapsing back in this game oh well fuck it then now
they keep on sayin' the same rappers are the best
jayz and kanye west
or maybe they just tryna distract you from the fact i'm comin' back
or maybe it's 'cause i ain't black maybe it's because of that
maybe it's 'cause i'm the highest selling artist in rap
while i'm sittin' back in my office jackin' off to my plaques
i'm still sick how can i be sick this long and i'm still alive
magic johnson of rhymes
i thrive on makin' my opponents think that i've died
that's when i just pop up outta nowhere oh yeah there we go there
damn i forgot how much money he got
on the beach of st tropez but your man don't lay
in the sun 'cause i don't tan i burn blood clot
when you gonna learn how much money we've earned
how does it feel to know i came in this game at twentyfive
and coulda retired at twentynine in my twenties still
and fif' hit a lick on that cocacola shit
he ain't even got to look at coke to even hold a brick no more
oh boy goddamn did he score
to go from sellin' bags to bottles right out the store
and shady hit the box office man he knocked the socks off us
my exwife is set for life you profitless cocksuckers
so stay the fuck off us we make pay
i'm just a super easy modest emcee okay
till i hear the word has been that's when i start spazzin'
smart asses kiss a smarter ass then
i'm the best thing that ever happened to rap bastards
i'm a blonde dre now gimme kanye's glasses
proof died what happened what happened
marshall stopped rapping damn
i guess that makes me the captain uhhuh hit the mattress okay
pistolpacking uhhuh sick assassin yeah
hit the gas and okay get to mashing
d12 broke up who you bitches asking
our clique's relaxing in the hills of aspen
popping pills and aspirin
and i'm the machine that brought marshall back to life
told him that my rhymes just have to be tight
so i figured that i would grab the mic
like a nigga 'bout to rhyme right after christ woo
sometimes we get mad and fight right back to the lab tonight
grab an o and i have to light
that's only right
living like a rock star is the only life
and we are six grown men who are old friends
to my nigga bugz deshaun holton

d12 nigga till the world end d12
a lot of niggas try to underestimate me

nah i aint your homey
if your name ain't em ferrari or tony
i like my wheel chromey
my bentley my rolly
my magnum my phonie
south jamaica shawty
these slugs i took in the gut yo
the work's still here i'm just cooking it up slow
clear my mind and whipping the truck low
youre looking for trouble
i pop death
youre looking to a sun dawg
if rap ain't work i be pimpin' on some ho
still eating lobster and shrimp in the bungalow
i'm back like crack over the drum roll
you know  wherever i go the gun go
the media will test ya popularity is pressure
porche panamera platinum hammer through the metal
wreck a booth up i'm too tough
that innercity grammar step your jewels up
they bruised up i'll sparkle for the camera
harsh reality's what pulls them
and holding them back from opening
verbal attack all over these niggas
push the herd to the back
i'm the kind that they prey on
spending half of they day on
lay on niggas for days the shots spray on
my sound system knock and it pound 2pac
6 4 jumping like the ground too hot
they spot me they chase a nigga down two blocks
two shots in the air for niggas that ain't here
two tone two door grey top blue floor
green guap galore in and out of new hall
that bright light you saw was a paparazzi flash
im tryna snap a picture through your maserati glass
there are enough insults in my head to fill up a swear jar
and have it overflowing
so don't get me going don't dare start
you'll never see me again amelia earhart
i'm popping a wheelie off to a really unfair start
i'm past grinding for me  guess i just be grounded up
like ground round or a pound of chuck
tightlywound as fuck
'til the fire marshalls come shut
fire marshall down and up
i suggest you better shut the fuck up
and stop fucking around and duck
i ain't playing this time i told you i'm out for blood
so to say i keep it 100 would probably sound redundant
like calling a bitch a ho or asking a gal to suck
and blow on your dick cock is she up to screwing down to fuck
it's a man's world and i'm trapped in a land of smut
with a thousand sluts strapped and muzzled
running through a house of mutts
in other words i'm shutting every one of you bitches' mouths up
and i'm watching my language if i tell you to kiss my fucking butt
and ain't shit changed my shit still don't stink player
my farts may have gotten staler ever since
i became a trailer park celebrity
maybe my complexion became a little paler
poster child for white trash
i'm a garbage pail kid sailor yeah
see me i'm all up on your bitch means i'ma rape her
all i got for these hoes is dick duct tape and a stapler
so bitch you better look for table scraps to scrape up
i don't subscribe to the news or the free press
but homie i get the paper
fucking stupid
if we gotta dumb down our style and abc it
then so be it cause nowadays these kids just
dont give a shit 'bout lyrics
all they wanna hear is a beat and that's it
long as they can go to the club and get blitzed
pick up some chicks and get some digits
and the dj's playing them hits
oh this my jam this my shit
we don't know a word to a verse all we know is the chorus
cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
and the song's ginormous the whole formulas switched
cause we dont know anymore what are hits
is it the beat is it the rap
is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap
and how do we adapt and get trl votes
when thirteenyearolds control the remotes
and ashlee's got a brand new nose
we gotta put some new emphasis on our syllalables
if the emphasis on the compact disc
is in the beat then im gon' feature em and get rich
and let dre mix the shit and drive off in the range ro'
cause everywhere i go they love the blingbling flow
bangbang look at the way my chain glow
the ring on my fing cost your man a lot of dough oh
the fuck am i bustin' my brain fo'
it's just the way the game go and oh it takes two to tango
you call this a lame flow you bought the shit
i guess you to blame too i just found an angle hahaha
no more reality flow
im tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
cock the mac11 in front of hot 97
and call my publicist tell her we in press heaven haha
no one gives a shit except
some kids that just got into sex on the internet
so you want the chatroom or the house in malibu
em your emphasis is on the wrong syllalable
they said thirty's the new twenty funny
must mean forty's the new thirty interesting
'cause ever since then it's been in a sense an extension
for veteran rappers that are better than half of
the shit coming out right now it's all trash
the torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
jay said its his last then 50 and em
then what detox drops what do we got then
so now our whole camps is running around
scrambling over what to do
gambling every time we put a record out
just lookin' for that hook wait dre look
go shawty it's your birthday woo
you made it just in time to hear my wordplay
it's the kid that flip flows who used to flip o's
and run g for days you should see how i get hoes
i'm international i get my dick licked 'round the globe
i'm sick right into shows ridin' on lolos yeah
puffin' on coco my bitch in manolos
dont fuck with the dodos that's slang for dumb hoes oh
i'm playin' i ain't got time to joke joke
you fuck around you could get your ass smoked loc
it's not a game me b i ain't playin' beat behind me playin'
so you don't hear anyway you dont hear what im sayin'
me finninina feefifidideeyay
just give me my check and ill be on my way
sunny bunny money and funny
you ain't even listening and i just took your money ha
there once was a time everywhere you turned 'where you turned
shadyaftermath was all you heard
but they say 50 sang too much and em got soft got soft
and they say dre just fell the fuck off woo
well fuck the fuckoffs all y'all eat salt
be mad we back fresh up outta the vault
oh new syllalables eat ball you fuckoffs
your house your bitch i'm getting sucked off
east south midwest even up north
falling victim to wax spitting bring out the white chalk
all for the gingerbread we get it and get lost
catch me if you can im runnin' past while y'all walk
shady made me for bringin' it back
'fore the history of rap is gone with a snap
a snare and a clap what happened to just spittin'
'bout livin' in the motherfuckin' city you at
in the grimiest condition i breathe in drama
king mathers and cashmethat's free karma
i'm everything anything you can never be
it's a hidden rhyme of the month deep in the beef
i speak with a piece no peace on my mind
i repeat every evil deed done of mine yeah
no rest contest contract to sign
by blood i'm in this squad for life
hear about out my windpipes and i just chime
i'm the reason you guys won't say that line
im crazy renegade like em and jayz
im rosemarys baby i want you to hate me
this is the part i was worried about
everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes
and i'm in some dusty garage
inhalin' them carbon monoxide fumes
and everyone's tellin' me what i should do
and how i should come out and what to rap about
and i know i got a lot up
in my medulla oblongata that i gotta get out
and i'm not sure how this is gonna come off
they're probably gonna think that i'm comin' off as cocky
like i just started givin' a fuck what you really think about me
see the thing about me
is you don't really know a thing about me
everyone's makin' a stink about me
like there's some kind of an aura of that of the king around me
surround me with nothin' but gangsters
killers and bangers and the most dangerous criminals
and i feel like i'm more comfortable around them
than i do my own motherfuckin' neighbors
but see my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when i leave
but why does it seem like i'm not even put up in the same category as other mc's
so when weezy says that he's better than jay z
please be that just subliminally
means he thinks jigga's the best
and that he's the only one up in that league see
and it's easy just to consider me
one of the greatest white rappers there is
knowin' goddamn well that i'm one of the best motherfuckin' rappers who ever lived period
maybe they figure that i'm on my way out the game
so they gotta go try to find 'em a new eminem or a new shady
if they think it's gonna happen man i thought i was crazy
or maybe i could be takin' it wrong
and they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way
so let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way
see you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringin' up that paul wall's white
cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone see he's just aight
and bubba sparxxx he just won't write
because he's so caught up in that snow white
that timbaland can't even get him in the studio
he's so gone off that coke right
and it's so sad cause he's dope right
america's next great white hope right
so now they feel like they gotta come up with some cornyass white rapper show right
and which i'm still havin' mixed feelings about
they said it'd be real i'm just spillin' it out
there's somethin' about a white boy talkin' black
and runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth
and i love when the say that tiger woods shit
isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white
and the best golfer's black
and i'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack off of that
but these are the people who never had heard of an eminem until 8 mile had came out
but i had already hit middle america
parents had all got to likin' me now
when suddenly i wasn't such a bad guy
all of the hatred for me must've died
thought i committed career suicide
so i had to turn back into the bad guy
so faggoty faggoty faggoty gays
anatomy god made raggedy ann and andy
not raggedy andy and andy and andy
and angelina jolie is just another ho
and brad is a sucka because once i fuck her
she wants to go to somalia to adopt another baby
you know what i say  no
you better save some of them kids from madonna
she needs all the publicity she can get
you wanted shady well you got it man i ain't apologizin' for shit
i feel like i'm morphin' into somethin' that's so incredible
that i'm dwarfin' all competitors
better get your girlfriend in check
it's psychological warfare endorphins i effect
your selfesteem shatters as dialect comes blastin' out your deck
she loves me such passion you'd expect
this sort of reaction from her yet you strongarm
you're fuckin' corny you try to turn your charm on
'cause you just think you're bishop the don juan
but if you think that you're fuckin' with me homie you're on one
i'm cockin' my head back like ed lover c'mon son
she's on my johnson she brings my name up constant
your boys are like she's fuckin' with dude she wants some
homeboy you better get a clue
she's on my dick 'cause i spit better than you
what you expect her to do
how you expect her to act in the sack when she's closin' her eyes
fantasizin' of diggin' her nails in my back to this track
she's sittin' there gettin' liquored up at the bar
she says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you
than to count the things that are
there's a sevendisc cd changer in her car
and i'm in every single slot and you're not  aww
i'm the logo on that dallas cowboy helmet a star
and i'm not about to sit back
and just keep rhymin' one syllable  naw
switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
'cause they're just not good enough but i'm not givin' up
'til i get my respect and i won't stop 'til i get enough
'cause i'm not livin' up to my own expectations aww
that hater alarm is soundin' off
and obama took the bomb from my name aww
so quit cryin' that i took your dame homie she's my dame aww
you sadly mistaken if you thinkin' that i'm not on my game boy
and things just ain't been the same since the day that i came forth
you wear your heart on your sleeve i sport that white tank boy
but you got a hardon for me what you hollerin' my name for
it's your bitch on my dick ain't my dang fault man i can't call it
it's like we're playin' lyrical tug of war with your ear
you hear it girl come here
put your ear up to the speaker dear
while i freak this world premiere
seducin' her loosen up
with a little freestyle that'll wait am i losin' ya
am i makin' you look bad well i got news for ya
homie you losin' her
oh wait she don't like when i spit it fast
am i tryin' to show how let me slow it down some
it's still gonna be a blowout
you're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see
if you can save any of it punk but none of it's fuckin' with me
prick you really feelin' that bullshit
you think you killin' them syllables quit
playin' these beats ain't nothin' to fool with
they call me fire marshall i shut the shit down
your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
i am also the opposite of what you are like
you're a microcosm of what the fuck i am on the mic
i am awesome and you are just awestruck
she's lovestricken she's got her jaw stuck
from suckin' my dick aw fuck
lately i really
feel like i'm rollin' for delf like philly
feel like i'm losin' control of myself i sincerely
apologize if all that i sound like
is i'm complainin' but life keeps on complicatin' and
i'm debatin' on leavin' this world this evenin'
even my girls can see i'm grievin' i try and hide it
but i can't why do i act like i'm all high and mighty
when inside i'm dyin' i am finally realizin' i need
help can't do it myself too weak
two weeks i've been havin' ups and downs
goin' through peaks and valleys
dillydallyin' 'round with the idea
of endin' this shit right here i'm hatin' my reflection
i walk around the house tryna fight mirrors
i can't stand what i look like yeah
i look fat but what do i care i give a fuck
only thing i fear's hailie
i'm afraid if i close my eyes

i've tried in this department but i ain't had no luck with this

mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly so say bye

how fuckin' irritated are you how much in your face am i
and ain't shit you can do but fear it proof is here in spirit
and i'm his spittin' image i mirror it when i stand near it
your pussy lyric i cunt hear it
who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists
i don't think she understands the sacrifices that i've made
maybe if this bitch had acted right i woulda stayed
but i've already wasted over half my life i woulda laid
down and died for you i no longer cry for you no more pain
bitch you took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
into the dirt i can no longer stand it
now my respect i demand it i'ma take control of this relationship command it
and i'ma be the boss of you now goddamn it
and what i mean is that i will no longer let you control me
so you better hear me out this much you owe me
i gave up my life for you totally devoted to you i have stayed
faithful all the way this is how i fuckin' get repaid
look at how i dress fuckin' baggy sweats go to work a mess
always in a rush to get back to you i ain't heard you yet
not even once say you appreciate me i deserve respect
i've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness
and i know that if i end this i'll no longer have nothin' left
but you keep treatin' me like a staircase it's time to fuckin' step
and i won't be comin' back so don't hold your fuckin' breath
you know what you've done no need to go indepth
i told you you'd be sorry if i fuckin' left i laughed while you wept
how's it feel now yeah funny ain't it you neglected me
did me a favor though my spirit free you've set
but a special place for you in my heart i have kept
it's unfortunate but it's
i feel like when i bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half till i snap
don't think i'm loyal all i do is rap
how can i moonlight on the side i have no life outside of that

jealous when i spend time with the girls why i'm married to you still
man i don't know but tonight i'm serving you with papers
i'm divorcing you  go marry someone else and make 'em famous
and take away their freedom like you did to me
treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat i'm moving on forget you
oh now i'm special i ain't feel special when i was with you
all i ever felt was this helplessness imprisoned by a selfish bitch
chew me up and spit me out i fell for this
so many times it's ridiculous and still i stick with this i'm sick of this
but in my sickness and addiction you're addictive as they get
evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em

shit i guess i'm a mess cursed and blessed but this time i
ain't changin' my mind i'm climbin' out this abyss

don't try to fight the feeling of somethin' that's so organic
you cant ignore it so don't just stand before it
just drop them panties to the floor lets get to camcordin'
damn shawty i told you this was bound to happen
soon as you wrote your number on the napkin
i was bound to work a number on your back
and throw your spine out of alignment
my love has got you so blind that
you couldn't pick amy winehouse out of a lineup
so stop at the store pick a pint up
let's get the pineapple schnapps going no one will knock
'cause i'ma hang a sign up saying don't disturb
shawty i'm so superb
i say the right things don't i spit the dopest words
i stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
they call me slim roethlisberger
i go berserker than a fedup post office worker
i murk her with a mossberg i'm pissed off get murdered
like someone took a ketchup squirter squirted a frankfurter
for a gangster you sure did shit your pants
when you saw the chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel
how thangs turn around when his fangs come out
get your brains blown out that's what i call blowin' your mind
when i come back like nut on your spine
i'm a thumb tack that you slept on son
now here i come screaming attack like i just stepped on one
low on the totem 'til he showed 'em defiance giant scrotum
he don't owe them bitches shit his britches he outgrowed 'em
he's so out cold he's knocked out at the south pole
and nobody fucks with him rigor mortis and post mortem
he's dyin' of boredom
take your best rhymes record 'em then try to thwart him
he'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
shitstained drawers you gon' fuck with a guy
who licks the blades of his chainsaws
while he dips 'em in pf chang's sauce
game's up homie hang it up like some crank calls
you think i'm backin' down
you must be out of your dang skulls i'm almost famous
i'm back for revenge i lost a battle that ain't happenin' again
i'm at your throat like strep i step strapped with a pen
metaphors wrote on my hand some are just stored in my memory
some i wrote on a napkin i do what i have to to win
pullin' out all stops any who touch a mic prior's
not even austin powers how the fuck are they mike myers
and tell that psycho to pass the torch to the wacko
'fore i take a shit in his jackolantern and smash it on his porch
now get off my dick 'dick''s too short of a word for my dick
get off my antidisestablishmentarianism you prick
don't call me the champ call me the space shuttle destroyer
i just blew up the challenger matter fact i need a lawyer
i just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast
beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like verne troyer
y'all are eminem backwards you're mini mes
see he's in a whole nother weight class
he's slugs you're bbs you're beanbag bullets
you're full of it you were dissin' his cd's
laughed at infinite now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties
no peace treaties he's turned into a beast
his new slim shady ep's got the attention of the mighty dre
he's almost famous
now there he goes in dre's studio cuppin' his balls
screamin' the wood off the panelin' cussin' the paint off the walls
spewin' his hate to these haters showin' no love for these broads
he ain't givin' them shit he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
he'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
with the scars 'til abraham lincoln is screamin' out ahh
these metaphors and similes ain't similar to them not at all
if they don't like it they can all get fucked
instead of suckin' him off
they can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by
like david carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die
and eat shit while they at it he's fuckin' had it
he's mad at the whole world
so go to hell and build a snowman girl
the bullies become bullied and pussies get pushed
then they better pull me take me back to 9th grade to school me
'cause i ain't lookin' back only forward this whole spot blowin'
who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it
and while i'm bein' poetic let me get it stoic and raise the bar
higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
so bear witness to some biblical shit there's a cold wind blowin'
this world ain't gonna know what hit it
he did it he made it he's finally famous
i can't tell you what it really is i can only tell you what it feels like
and right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
i can't breathe but i still fight while i can fight
as long as the wrong feels right it's like i'm in flight
high off her love drunk from her hate
it's like i'm huffin' paint and i love her the more i suffer i suffocate
and right before i'm about to drown she resuscitates me
she fuckin' hates me and i love it  wait
where you going  i'm leaving you  no you ain't
come back  we're runnin' right back here we go again
it's so insane 'cause when it's goin' good it's goin' great
i'm superman with the wind at his back she's lois lane
but when it's bad it's awful i feel so ashamed
i snapped who's that dude i don't even know his name
i laid hands on her i'll never stoop so low again
i guess i don't know my own strength
you ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
you meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
got that warm fuzzy feelin' yeah them chills used to get 'em
now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
you swore you'd never hit 'em never do nothin' to hurt 'em
now you're in each other's face
spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
you push pull each other's hair scratch claw bit 'em
throw 'em down pin 'em
so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
it's the rage that took over it controls you both
so they say you're best to go your separate ways
guess that they don't know ya
'cause today that was yesterday yesterday is over
it's a different day sound like broken records playin' over
but you promised her next time you'll show restraint
you don't get another chance life is no nintendo game
but you lied again
now you get to watch her leave out the window
guess that's why they call it window pane
now i know we said things did things that we didn't mean
then we fall back into the same patterns same routine
but your temper's just as bad as mine is you're the same as me
when it comes to love you're just as blinded baby please
come back it wasn't you baby it was me
maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is i love you too much to walk away though
come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk
don't you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk
told you this is my fault look me in the eyeball
next time i'm pissed i'll aim my fist at the drywall
next time there won't be no next time
i apologize even though i know it's lies
i'm tired of the games i just want her back i know i'm a liar
if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again i'ma tie her
to the bed and set this house on fire just gonna
if proof could see me now i know he'd be proud
somewhere in me deep down there's something in me he found
that made him believe in me now no one can beat me now
you try it'll be them doors on dre's phantom believe me clowns
that means suicide homie you'll never throw me
off of this course blow me bitch i do this all for the sport only
but i want it all i'm not just talkin' awards homie
and the ball's in my court and it's lonely
on top of the world when you're the only one
with the balls in your shorts
to leave their jaws on the floors with no remorse
'member that when they get to doggin' you boy homie
so y'all can just get to bloggin' about bologna
i'm not gonna stop the saga continues no stoppin' the force obi
i'm moppin' the floors with 'em i keep tryna pass it but they keep on
droppin' the torch and it won't be long 'til this sport is ov
er just blaze and me we are knockin' on doors and no we
ain't pumpkins on halloween but we'll show up on your porch so be
careful what you say there ain't no punks over here so follow me
through the fog like i'm sndoubleop let me guide you through the smoke g
if only i wasn't travelin' down this road by my lonely
no one who knew me like you will ever know me
i don't think you understand how much you meant to me
for you i wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
so sick it'll blow up the mic it'll put the dyna in mite
yeah it'll make the dopest mc wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
tap dancin' all over the beat it'll jump off the page and spit itself
guess that the best thing i can do right now doody for you is to rep
so i'm gonna fuck 'til i die yeah i'ma do it to death
and instead of mournin' your death i'd rather celebrate your life
elevate to new heights step on the gas and accelerate i'ma need two mics
'cause the way that i'm feelin' tonight everything i can just do right
there's nothin' that i can do wrong i'm too strong and i'm just too hype
just finish the rhyme and i bust it excuse the corny metaphor
but they'll never catch up to all this energy that i've mustered
so god just help me out while i fight through this grievin' process
tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous
but this depression ain't takin' me hostage i've been patiently watchin'
this game pacin' these hallways you had faith in me always
proof you knew i'd come out of this slump rise from these ashes
come right back on their asses and go mike tyson on these bastards
and i'ma show 'em blow 'em out the water slaughter 'em homes
i'ma own so many belts only place they can hit me is below 'em
homie i know i'm never gonna be the same without you
i never woulda came in this game i'm goin' insane without you
matter fact it was just the other night had another dream about you
you told me to get up i got up i spread my wings and i flew
you gave me a reason to fight i was on my way to see you
you told me naw doody you're not layin' on that table i knew
i was gonna make it soon as you said think of hailie i knew
there wasn't no way that i was ever gonna leave them babies and proof
not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
lord i'm so thankful please don't think that i don't feel grateful i do
just grant me the strength that i need for one more day to get through
so homie this is your song i dedicate this to you
i love you doody
girl i think you just might've tried to pull a motherfuckin' fast one i'm mad

or get sauteed and rotisseried while you're hogtied
mc's get so quiet you can hear a motherfuckin' dog whistle when i walk by
colt seavers on a mule stuntin' on that ass like the fuckin' fall guy
i don't gas my mercedes after midnight i treat it like a mogwai
'cause it will turn into a gremlin and run over kids women and men
vrinnvrinnmotor so big you can fit a midget in his engine
bitch give me them digits why you cringin' not by the hair on my chinnychinchin

so bad you will have kurt cobain askin' to autograph a bloodstained napkin

it's like apples to oranges peaches to plums yeah
i'm bananas pussy cut off the grapes and grow a pair
but i swear you try to diss me i'll slaughter you
i put that on everything like everyone does with autotune
the last thing you want to do is have me spit out a rhyme
and say i was writing this and i thought of you so
i went away i guess and opened up some lanes
but there was no one who even knew
i was goin' through growin' pains
hatred was flowin' through my veins
on the verge of goin' insane
i almost made a song dissin' lil wayne
it's like i was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
i felt horrible about myself he was spittin' and i wasn't
anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
almost went at kanye too
god it feels like i'm goin' psychotic thank god that i didn't do it
i'da had my ass handed to me and i knew it
but proof wasn't here to see me through it
i'm in the booth poppin' another pill tryna talk myself into it
are you stupid you're gon' start dissin' people for no reason
'specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even you're lyin' to yourself you're slowly dyin'
you're denyin' your health is declinin' with your selfesteem
you're cryin' out for help
marshall you're no longer the man that's a bitter pill to swallow
all i know is i'm wallowing selfloathing and hollow
bottoms up on the pill bottle maybe i'll hit my bottom tomorrow
my sorrow echoes in this hall though ohoh oh
but i must be talkin' to the wall though i don't see nobody else
i guess i keep talkin' to myself
but all these other rappers suck is all that i know
i've turned into a hater i put up a false bravado
but marshall is not an egomaniac that's not his motto
he's not a desperado he's desperate
his thoughts are bottled inside him
one foot on the brake one on the throttle
fallin' asleep with writer's block in the parkin' lot of mcdonald's
but instead of feeling sorry for yourself
do something 'bout it admit you got a problem
your brain is clouded you pouted long enough
it isn't them it's you you fuckin' baby
quit worryin' 'bout what they do and do shady
i'm fuckin' goin' crazy
so i picked myself up off the ground
and fuckin' swam 'fore i drowned
hit my bottom so hard i bounced twice suffice this time around
it's different them last two albums didn't count
encore i was on drugs relapse i was flushin' 'em out
i've come to make it up to you now no more fuckin' around
i got somethin' to prove to fans 'cause i feel like i let 'em down
so please accept my apology i finally feel like i'm back to normal
i feel like me again let me formally
reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
the new me's back to the old me

wrap a lizard in gauze
beat you in the jaws with it grab the scissors and saws
and cut out your livers gizzards and balls
throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with jaws
so sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
got the gall to make chris piss in his drawers
tickle him go to his grave skip him and visit his dog
i just put a bullshit hook in between two longass verses
if you mistook this for a song look this ain't a song
it's a warning to brooke hogan and david cook
that the crook just took over so book
run as fast as you can stop writing and kill it
i'm lightning in a skillet you're a fuckin' flash in the pan
i pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashing a fan

but i would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
come back and whip your ass with it again
saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
it'll eat through anything metal the ass of iron man
turn him into plastic
so for you to think that you could stand a fuckin' chance is asinine

and they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
then how the fuck have i been hit six times
in three different locations on four separate occasions
and you can bet your stankin' ass

and walk around the party without a care like a body without a head

'til i feel like i been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
i'm mixin' hennessy and fanta with pepto and mylanta
i shoot the gift like im hollering die santa
missed the tree and hit rudolph and two innocent bystanders
so quit tryna play the wall like you paul
and get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
they call me the stephon marbury of rap darlin'
'cause as soon as they throw on some r kelly i start ballin'
makin' it rain for the ladies in the minis
but im not throwin' ones fives 10's or even 20's
im throwin' quarters nickels dimes pennies up at skinnies

so ladies if your belly buttons not an innie then im outtie

ill tell you now im so raw i still need to unthaw
you feel me y'all i shut the club down like drake in the mall
but baby a body like thats against the law

coleslaw containers empty straw wrappers and all
you got more junk in your trunk than i do in my car
now get up
you can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before i lay 'em
but you won't take the sting out these words before i say 'em
'cause ain't no way i'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
when i say i'ma do somethin' i do it
i don't give a damn what you think i'm doin' this for me
so fuck the world feed it beans
it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
i'ma be what i set out to be without a doubt undoubtably
and all those who look down on me
i'm tearin' down your balcony
no ifs ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
from infinite down to the last relapse album he's still shittin'
whether he's on salary paid hourly
until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
whichever comes first for better or worse
he's married to the game
like a fuck you for christmas his gift is a curse
forget the earth he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
and fuck the whole universe
okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit and cut the crap
i shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm
for you to know it's a rap
you said you was king you lied through your teeth
for that fuck your feelings
instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped
and to the fans i'll never let you down again i'm back
i promise to never go back on that promise
in fact let's be honest that last relapse cd was ehh
perhaps i ran them accents into the ground
relax i ain't goin' back to that now
all i'm tryin' to say is get back clickclackblaow
'cause i ain't playin' around
there's a game called circle and i don't know how
i'm way too up to back down
but i think i'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
thought i had it mapped out but i guess i didn't
this fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
but it's time to exorcise these demons
these muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
it was my decision to get clean i did it for me
admittedly i probably did it subliminally for you
so i could come back a brandnew me
you helped see me through
and don't even realize what you did believe me you
i've been through the wringer
but they can do little to the middle finger
i think i got a tear in my eye i feel like the king of
my world haters can make like bees with no stingers
and drop dead no more beef lingers
no more drama from now on i promise
to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
so i solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
and raise it you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'cause the way i feel i'm strong enough to go to the club
or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'cause i'm raisin' the bar
i'd shoot for the moon but i'm too busy gazin' at stars
i feel amazin' and i'm
my mom my mom i know you're probably tired
of hearin' 'bout my mom ohho whoaho
but this is just a story of when i was just a shorty
and how i became hooked on vaaliuum
valium was in everything food that i ate
the water that i drank fuckin' peas in my plate
she sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
so every day i'd have at least three stomachaches
now tell me what kind of mother would want to see her
son grow up to be an underafuckin'chiever
my teacher didn't think i was gonna be nothin' either
what the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fuckin' seat for
mrs mathers your son has been huffin' ether
either that or the motherfucker's been puffin' reefer
but all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
it was neither i was buzzin' but it wasn't what she thought
pee in a teacup bitch you ain't my keeper i'm sleepin'
what the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for
slut you need to leave me the fuck alone i ain't playin'
go find you a white crayon and color a fuckin' zebra
wait a minute this ain't dinner this is paint thinner
you ate it yesterday i ain't hear no complaints did i
now here's a plate full of painkillers now just wait
'til i crush the valium and put it in your potatoes
you little motherfucker i'll make you sit there and make
that retarded fuckin' face without even tastin' it
you better lick the fuckin' plate you ain't wastin' it
put your face in it 'fore i throw you in the basement again
and i ain't givin' in you're gonna just sit there
in one fuckin' place finnickin' 'til next thanksgiving
and if you still ain't finished it i'll use the same shit again
then when i make spinach dip it'll be placed in the shit
you little shit wanna sit there and play innocent

was that i had developed a crush

footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk
we'll settle this once and for all i'ma tell her at dusk

location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped
the trunk that they were stuffed in the model the make the plate

prises when the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
you stare into your stereos high
good evening this isn't even a weed thing
i ain't even smoke anything i ain't even drinking
as i fall deeper into a manic state
i'm a prime candidate for the gene
to receive the drug addict trait
blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
i seem to gravitate to the bottle of nyquil then i salivate
start off with the nyquil like i think i'll just have a taste
couple of sips of that then i gradually graduate
to a harder prescription drug called valium
like yeah that's great
i go to just take one and i end up like having eight
now i need something in my stomach 'cause i haven't ate
maybe i'll grab a plate of nachos and i'll have a steak
and you'd think that with all i have at stake
look at my daughter's face
mommy something is wrong with dad i think
he's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me
won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
and all he does is eat doritos and cheetos
and he just fell asleep in his car eating 3 musketeers in the rear seat
maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer
that's the devil in my ear i've been sober a fuckin' year
and that fucker still talks to me he's all i can fucking hear
marshall come on we'll watch the game
it's the cowboys and buccaneers
and maybe if i just drink half
i'll be halfbuzzed for half of the time
who's the mastermind behind that little line
with that kind of rationale man i got half a mind
to have another half a glass of wine
sounds asinine yeah i know
but i never had no problem with alcohol
ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch i'm 'bout to fall
i miss the couch and down i go lookin' like a bouncy ball
shit must've knocked me out 'cause i ain't feel the ground at all
wow what the fuck happened last night where am i
man fuck am i hungover and goddamn i got a headache
shit half a vicodin why can't i
all systems ready for take off please stand by
so i take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach then ahhh
couple of weeks go by it ain't even like i'm gettin' high
now i need it just not to feel sick yeah i'm gettin' by
wouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die
oh yeah there's an excuse you lose proof so you use
there's new rules it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
it's twelvenoon ain't no harm in selfinducin' a snooze
what else is new fuck it what would elvis do in your shoes
now here i am three months later fullblown relapse
just get high until the kids get home from school homes relax
and since i'm convinced that i'm an insomniac
i need these pills to be able to sleep so i take three naps
just to be able to function throughout the day let's see
that's an ambien each nap how many valium three
and that will average out to about one good hour's sleep
okay so now ya see the reason how come he
has taken four years to just put out an album b
see me and you we almost had the same outcome heath
'cause that christmas you know the whole pneumonia thing
it was bologna was it the methadone ya think
or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
your vcr tape cases with your ambien cr
great places to hide 'em ain't it so you can lie to hailie
i'm going beddybye whitney baby good night alaina
go in the room and shut the bedroom door
and wake up in an ambulance
they said they found me on the bathroom floor damn
i'm just so fuckin' depressed
i just can't seem to get out this slump
if i could just get over this hump
but i need somethin' to pull me out this dump
i took my bruises took my lumps
fell down and i got right back up
but i need that spark to get psyched back up
in order for me to pick the mic back up
i don't know how or why or when
i ended up in this position i'm in
i'm starting to feel distant again
so i decided just to pick this pen
up and try to make an attempt to vent
but i just can't admit
or come to grips with the fact that i may be done with rap
i need a new outlet
and i know some shit's so hard to swallow
but i just can't sit back and wallow
in my own sorrow but i know one fact
i'll be one tough act to follow
one tough act to follow i'll be one tough act to follow
here today gone tomorrow
but you'd have to walk a thousand miles
i think i'm starting to lose my sense of humor
everything's so tense and gloom
i almost feel like i gotta check the temperature
of the room just as soon as
i walk in it's like all eyes on me
so i try to avoid any eye contact
cause if i do that then it opens a door
for conversation like i want that
i'm not lookin' for extra attention
i just wanna be just like you
blend in with the rest of the room
maybe just point me to the closest restroom
i don't need no fuckin' man servant
tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
laugh at every single joke i crack
and half of 'em ain't even funny like ha
marshall you're so funny man
you should be a comedian goddamn
unfortunately i am
i just hide behind the tears of a clown
so why don't you all sit down
listen to the tale i'm about to tell
hell we don't gotta trade our shoes
and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles
nobody asked for life to deal us
with these bullshit hands we're dealt
we gotta take these cards ourselves
and flip 'em don't expect no help
now i could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
or take this situation in which i'm placed in
and get up and get my own
i was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
and sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
for a dad to show up who never did
i just wanted to fit in in every single place every school i went
i dreamed of being that cool kid
even if it meant acting stupid
aunt edna always told me
keep making that face it'll get stuck like that
meanwhile i'm just standin' there
holdin' my tongue tryin' to talk like this
'til i stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
i learned my lesson then
cause i wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
but i already told you my whole life story
not just based on my description
cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
it's probably 110 different
i guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
what size you wear i wear 10's
let's see if you can fit your feet

i dig 'til i find it i wind it up and the tune just starts
it's playing a song so beautiful and the room is dark
the moon is full i smell a funeral guess i'll loom in the park
i'm fixated on asphyxiatin' and breakin'
this little chick's neck like a pixy stick
the sick satanworshippin' bitches get horse whippings

but before i do that i'll have a chat to flatter her
give her two compliments back to back like tabitha

we get to beefin' ain't no tellin' at what point it'll stop
all i got to do is point to the spot when the bomb drops
boy does it drop and when it does boy there's a problem
boy don't jinx yourself boy i'm micheal spinks with the belt
stringer bell boy my name rings bells for itself
i'm sick as hell boy you better run and tell someone else
bringin' hell boy singin' telegrams and get dealt
and to that boy on them sedative meds who said he was better
i bet he never seen freddy in a black and red little sweater
back better than ever the cheddar shredder the grater
the beef grinder i'll settle vendettas a little later
givin' haters incubators think you made a mistake
by sayin' shady was ghost i ain't even close to the gate
you got one foot in the grave just stay put and behave
i'm 'bout to turn this fuckin' place to beirut in a day
so hey wouldn't you say i'm the shit couldn't agree with you more
if you were to say that my fuckin' shit doesn't stink
shadyfuckin'aftermath boy the ship doesn't sink
it just floats in the fuckin' water 'til we fill up the tank
yeah look
if i were to rap about the crap that's out
that's the route you probably want me to take
cause you're just dyin' to know what i think
hear my take on some other rappers
if i was to say somethin' about paul wall
you'd probably crap in your pants cause i'm white and he's white
so he's like my competition i mean right
nope paul wall is dope and so is bubba
so bbbbbb but i don't compete with nobody
i just go hard do the ropeadope ali shuffle
and dance around my opponents do donuts
sometimes i play possum like i'm asleep it's awesome
i'm like a sleepin' giant and when i awake i'm like dre
i just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
and sink my teeth in 'em and fill 'em
full of poison and make a noise like a snake before i kill 'em
and let 'em know that i just don't feel 'em
and smack 'em with the backward e the eminem emblem
i was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face him
tell him why look him dead in the eye then waste him
and the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
then swallow the shell all the hollow who dwell
in the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
for this rap game and it gggoes
onetwothree chkchk onetwothree
chkchk onetwothree that ain't the hook now follow me
there's nothing else for me to say my public adores me
everybody bores me they're just so corny
so at night before i sleep i look in the mirror
the mirror grows lips and it whispers come nearer
shady i know you're in there somewhere come here
talk to me sit here pull up a chair
why don't you cut your hair
ha ha ha ha ha ha dye it back come on try it

drugs you became a lot softer
but dre all shady is is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka

i'm not in the mirror i'm inside you
let me guide you  fuck you die you son of a bitch
put the gun down  byebye boom
okay i'm still alive  so am i too
you can't kill a spirit even if you tried to
haha you sold your soul to me need i remind you
you remember that night you prayed to god
you'd give anything to get a record deal well dre signed you
this is what you wanted your whole life marshall right ooh
look at this house look at these cars they're so nice woo
oh but you didn't know fame has a price too
that you just now seeing the downside to
lose your best friend from high school your wife too
ain't even sure if your kids like you
come off tour can't even sleep at night without nyquil
become a valium addict start a rehab cycle
but together we can break the cycle
marshall  what  no one's gonna love you like i do
chainsaw starting up
so this is it this is what i wished for
just isn't how i envisioned it fame to the point of imprisonment
i just thought the shit'd be different
but somethin' changed the minute that i got a whiff of it
i started to inhale it smell it started sniffin' it
and it became my cocaine i just couldn't quit
i just wanted a little bit then it turned me to a monster
i became a hypocrite concert after concert
i was rakin' in the dough rollin' in green
had the game hemmed up like a sewing machine
but i was losing my freedom there was nowhere for me
to not go and be seen and just go and be me
and there was no inbetween you either loved it or hate it
every cd critics gave it a three then three
years later they go back and rerate it
then called the slim shady lp the greatest
the marshall mathers was a classic
the eminem show was fantastic
but encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
i guess enough time just ain't passed yet
a couple more years that shit'll be illmatic
and eight years later i'm still at it
divorced remarried a felon a father sleeping pill addict
and this is real talk i feel like the incredible hulk
my back has been broke and i can still walk
i got a letter from a fan that said he's been praying for me
every day and for some reason
it's been weighing on my mind heavy
'cause i don't read every letter i get
but something told me to go ahead and open it
but why would someone pray for you
when they don't know you
you didn't pray for me when i was local
and as i lay these vocals i think of all the shit i had to go through
just to get to where i'm at i've already told you
at least a thousand times in these rhymes
i appreciate the prayer but i've already got god on my side
and it's been one hell of a ride hasn't it
just watching it from a opposite standpoint
man boy's got to look
nuts and that's the only word i can think of
right now on how to describe the shit
this is like a vibe you get go ahead and bop to it
just watch what you wish for 'cause i got the shit
oh yeah god i never seen no chick like this
this bitch can twist like a damn contortionist
condom on my dick of course it is
this bitch don't know what abortion is
so i can't cum in her fucks like a porn star

ow fuck i think it's stuck
ow but it feels so fucking good
i sit back with this pack of zigzag's and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest mc on this on this earth
and since birth i've been cursed with this curse to just curse
and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensin' these sentences
gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
of this chest and i rest again peacefully peacefully
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone when you freaks see me out
in the streets when i'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
to not come and speak to me speak to me i don't know you
and no i don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
i'm not mr n'sync i'm not what your friends think
i'm not mr friendly i can be a prick
if you tempt me my tank is on empty is on empty
no patience is in me and if you offend me
i'm liftin' you ten feet liftin' you ten feet in the air
i don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit
i'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
i'm tired of all you of all you i don't mean to be mean
but that's all i can be it's just me
sometimes i just feel like my father i hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense it's constant
and oh it's his lyrical content
the song 'guilty conscience' has gotten such rotten responses
and all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me finger at me
so i point one back at 'em but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb it's the one you put up
when you don't give a fuck when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull 'cause they full of shit too
when a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on marilyn on marilyn and the heroin
where were the parents at and look where it's at
middle america now it's a tragedy
now it's so sad to see an upperclass city
havin' this happenin' this happenin' then attack
eminem 'cause i rap this way rap this way but i'm glad
'cause they feed me the fuel that i need for the fire to burn
and it's burnin' and i have returned
i'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
that i wish that i would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label let's stop with the fables
i'm not gonna be able to top a my name is
and pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
to cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
and i just do not got the patience got the patience
to deal with these cocky caucasians
who think i'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause i talk
with an accent and grab on my balls so they always
keep askin' the same fuckin' questions fuckin' questions
what school did i go to what hood i grew up in
the why the who what when the where and the how
'til i'm grabbin' my hair and i'm tearin' it out
'cause they drivin' me crazy drivin' me crazy i can't take it
i'm racin' i'm pacin' i stand and i sit
and i'm thankful for every fan that i get
but i can't take a shit in the bathroom without
someone standin' by it standin' by it no i won't sign your autograph

well since age 12 i felt like i'm someone else
'cause i hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
got pissed off and ripped pamela lee's tits off
and smacked her so hard i knocked her clothes backwards like kris kross
i smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast

my english teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high shh

i smacked him in his face with an eraser chased him with a stapler
and stapled his nuts to a stack of paper ow
walked in the strip club had my jacket zipped up
flashed the bartender then stuck my dick in the tip cup
extraterrestrial running over pedestrians in a spaceship while they're screaming at me let's just be friends
99 percent of my life i was lied to
i just found out my mom does more dope than i do damn
i told her i'd grow up to be a famous rapper
make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her

i'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
huh yup
am i comin' or goin' i can barely decide
i just drank a fifth of vodka dare me to drive go ahead
all my life i was very deprived
i ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide whoops
clothes ripped like the incredible hulk
i spit when i talk i'll fuck anything that walks come here
when i was little i used to get so hungry i would throw fits
how you gonna breastfeed me mom you ain't got no tits
i lay awake and strap myself in the bed
with a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head bang
'cause i'm steamin' mad grr
and by the way when you see my dad yeah
tell him that i slit his throat in this dream i had
dear slim i wrote you but you still ain't callin'
i left my cell my pager and my home phone at the bottom
i sent two letters back in autumn you must not've got 'em
there probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
sometimes i scribble addresses too sloppy when i jot 'em
but anyways fuck it what's been up man how's your daughter
my girlfriend's pregnant too i'm 'bout to be a father
if i have a daughter guess what i'ma call her
i'ma name her bonnie

anyways i hope you get this man hit me back
just to chat truly yours your biggest fan this is stan
dear slim you still ain't called or wrote i hope you have a chance
i ain't mad i just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
if you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert you didn't have to
but you coulda signed an autograph for matthew
that's my little brother man he's only six years old
we waited in the blisterin' cold
for you for four hours and you just said no
that's pretty shitty man you're like his fuckin' idol
he wants to be just like you man he likes you more than i do
i ain't that mad though i just don't like bein' lied to
remember when we met in denver
you said if i'd write you you would write back
see i'm just like you in a way i never knew my father neither
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
i can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
so when i have a shitty day i drift away and put 'em on
cause i don't really got shit else
so that shit helps when i'm depressed
i even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
sometimes i even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
it's like adrenaline the pain is such a sudden rush for me
see everything you say is real and i respect you cause you tell it
my girlfriend's jealous 'cause i talk about you 247
but she don't know you like i know you slim no one does
she don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
you gotta call me man i'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
sincerely yours stanps we should be together too
dear mr i'mtoogoodtocallorwritemyfans

i hope you know i ripped all of your pictures off the wall
i loved you slim we coulda been togetherthink about it
you ruined it now i hope you can't sleep and you dream about it

you got some issues stan i think you need some counselin'
to help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
and what's this shit about us meant to be together
that type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
i really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
i hope you get to read this letter i just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself i think that you'll be doin' just fine
if you relax a little i'm glad i inspire you but stan
why are you so mad try to understand that i do want you as a fan
i just don't want you to do some crazy shit
i seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape but they didn't say who it was to
come to think about it his name wasit was you
his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
there's vomit on his sweater already mom's spaghetti
he's nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
to drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
he opens his mouth but the words won't come out
he's choking how everybody's joking now
the clock's run out time's up overblaow
snap back to reality ope there goes gravity ope
there goes rabbit he choked he's so mad but he won't
give up that easy no he won't have it he knows
his whole back's to these ropes it don't matter he's dope
he knows that but he's broke he's so stagnant he knows
when he goes back to this mobile home that's when it's
back to the lab again yo this old rap shit he
better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him and
his soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
this world is mine for the taking make me king
as we move toward a new world order
a normal life is boring but superstardom's
close to postmortem it only grows harder
homie grows hotter he blows it's all over
these hoes is all on him coasttocoast shows
he's known as the globetrotter lonely roads
god only knows he's grown farther from home he's no father
he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
but hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
these hoes don't want him no mo' he's cold product
they moved on to the next schmoe who flows
he nosedove and sold nada and so the soap opera
is told it unfolds i suppose it's old partner
but the beat goes on dadadom dadom dahdah dahdah
no more games i'ma change what you call rage
tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
i was playin' in the beginning the mood all changed
i've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
but i kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
all the pain inside amplified by the
fact that i can't get by with my nineto
five and i can't provide the right type of life for my family
'cause man these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
and there's no movie there's no mekhi phifer this is my life
and these times are so hard and it's gettin' even harder
tryna feed and water my seed plus teetertotter
caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
baby mama drama screamin' on her too much for me to wanna
stay in one spot another day of monotony's
gotten me to the point i'm like a snail i've got
to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
success is my only motherfuckin' optionfailure's not
mom i love you but this trailer's got
to go i cannot grow old in salem's lot
so here i go it's my shot feet fail me not
this may be the only opportunity that i got
get buzzed get drunk get crunk get fucked up
hit the strip club don't forget ones get your dick rubbed
get fucked get sucked get wasted shitfaceted
pasted plastered  puke drink throw up
get a new drink hit the bathroom sink throw up
wipe your shoe clean got a routine goin'
still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
i was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
i was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
them hips and licked them lips and that was it
i had to get nate dogg here to sing some shit
two to the one from the one to the three
i like good pussy and i like good tree
smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
and i get mo' ass than a toilet seat
three to the one from the one to the three
i met a bad bitch last night in the d
let me tell you how i made her leave with me
conversation and hennessy
i've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
heard motherfuckers talk seen 'em drop
if i ain't got a weapon i'ma pick up a rock
and when i bust yo' ass i'm gon' continue to rock
get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
it's real easy just follow the beat
don't let that fine girl pass you by
look real close 'cause strobe lights lie
i'm a menace a dentist an oral hygienist
open your mouth for about four or five minutes
take a little bit of this fluoride rininse
swish but don't spit it swallow it and now finish
yeah me and nate do doubleg
lookin' for a couple bitches with some double d's
pop a little champagne and a couple e's
slip it in her bubbly we finna finna
now look at this lady all in front of me sexy as can be
tonight i want a slut would you be mine
heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
now i hope you don't get mad at me
but i told nate you was a freak
he said he wants a slut hope you don't mind
i told him how you like it from behind
these ideas are nightmares to white parents
whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
like whatever they say has no bearing
it's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
to see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
alone in his own zone cold and he don't care he's
a problem child and what bothers him all comes out
when he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out bitch
'cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
his thoughts are wacked he's mad so he's talkin' back
talkin' black brainwashed from rock and rap
he sags his pants dorags and a stockin' cap
his stepfather hit him so he socked him back
and broke his nose his house is a broken home
there's no control he just lets his emotions go
entertainment is changin' intertwinin' with gangsters
in the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
holy or unholy only have one homie
only this gun lonely cause don't anyone know me
yet everybody just feels like they can relate huhuh
i guess words are a motherfucker they can be great
or they can degrade or even worse they can teach hate
it's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum
now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
from standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
to havin' a fortune no more kissin' ass
but then these critics crucify you yep journalists try to burn you
fans turn on you attorneys all want a turn at you
to get they hands on every dime you have
they want you to lose your mind every time you mad
so they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
that's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
but all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
so i'm signin' cds while police fingerprint me
they're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
if i'm such a fuckin' menace this shit doesn't make sense b
it's all political if my music is literal
and i'm a criminal how the fuck can i raise a little girl
i couldn't i wouldn't be fit to
you're full of shit too guerrera that was a fist that hit you bitch
they say music can alter moods and talk to you
well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too
well if it can then the next time you assault a dude
just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get sued
see what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
and they wanna get one cause they think the shit's cool
not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
we entertainers of course the shit's affectin' our sales
you ignoramus but music is reflection of self
we just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail
it's fucked up ain't it how we can come from practically nothin'
to bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
that's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine haha
who post pinup pictures on they walls all day long
idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
so they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die
'til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
we're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
that's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
squeeze it and hold it cause we consider these minutes golden
and maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our spirits
live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can
i've created a monster 'cause nobody wants to
see marshall no more they want shady i'm chopped liver
well if you want shady this is what i'll give ya
a little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
than a shock when i get shocked at the hospital
by the doctor when i'm not cooperating
when i'm rocking the table while he's operating hey
you waited this long now stop debating
cause i'm back i'm on the rag and ovulating
i know that you got a job ms cheney
but your husband's heart problem's complicating
so the fcc won't let me be
or let me be me so let me see
they try to shut me down on mtv
but it feels so empty without me
so come on and dip bum on your lips
fuck that cum on your lips and some on your tits
and get ready cause this shit's about to get heavy
i just settled all my lawsuitsfuck you debbie
little hellions kids feeling rebellious
embarrassed their parents still listen to elvis
they start feeling like prisoners helpless
'til someone comes along on a mission and yells bitch
a visionary vision is scary
could start a revolution polluting the airwaves
a rebel so just let me revel and bask
in the fact that i got everyone kissing my ass smack
and it's a disaster such a catastrophe
for you to see so damn much of my assyou asked for me
well i'm back nananananananananana
fix your bent antenna tune it in and then i'm gonna
enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
the center of attention back for the winter
i'm interesting the best thing since wrestling
infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
testing attention please
feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
here's my ten cents my two cents is free
a nuisance who sent you sent for me
a tiskit a taskit i'll go tit for tat with
anybody who's talking this shit that shit
chris kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked
worse than them little limp bizkit bastards
and moby you can get stomped by obie
you 36yearold baldheaded fag blow me
you don't know me you're too old let go
it's over nobody listens to techno
now let's go just give me the signal
i'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
i've been dope suspenseful with a pencil
ever since prince turned himself into a symbol
but sometimes the shit just seems
everybody only wants to discuss me
so this must mean i'm disgusting
but it's just me i'm just obscene
though i'm not the first king of controversy
i am the worst thing since elvis presley
to do black music so selfishly
and use it to get myself wealthy hey
there's a concept that works
twenty million other white rappers emerge
but no matter how many fish in the sea
it'd be so empty without me
i'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
i ain't never supposed to show it
my crew ain't supposed to know it
even if it means goin' toetotoe with a benzino
it don't matter i never drag 'em in battles that i can't handle
'less i absolutely have to i'm supposed to set an example
i need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide 'em
if some shit ever does pop off i'm supposed to be beside 'em
that ja shit i tried to squash it it was too late to stop it
there's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
i heard him say hailie's name on a song and i just lost it
it was crazy the shit went way beyond some jayz and nas shit
and even though the battle was won i feel like we lost it
i spent so much energy on it honestly i'm exhausted
and i'm so caught in it that i almost feel i'm the one who caused it
this ain't what i'm in hiphop for that's not why i got in it
that was never my object for someone to get killed
why would i wanna destroy something i helped build
that wasn't my intentions my intentions were good
i went through my whole career without ever mentionin'
and that was just outta respect for not runnin' my mouth
and talkin' about somethin' that i knew nothin' about
plus dre told me stay out this just wasn't my beef
so i did i just fell back watched and gritted my teeth
while he's all over tv downtalkin' the man
who literally saved my life like fuck it i understand
this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
but still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute 'cause
there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
but now it's elevated 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
the shit gets escalatedit ain't just words no more is it
it's a different ballgame you call names and you ain't just rappin'
we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happenin'
me and dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
and asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
until ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
fuck it 50 smash him mash on him let him have it
meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk
has an erection for me and thinks that i'll be his resurrection
tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
but now he's fucked the game up
'cause one of the ways i came up
was through that publication the same one that made me famous
now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
well fuck it that motherfucker could get it too fuck him then
but i'm so busy bein' pissed off i don't stop to think
that we just inherited 50's beef with murder inc
and he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
but we still have soldiers that's on the front line
who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
never to extort us strictly to show they support us
and maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
to show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important
it is to have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners
their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
but i ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
it ain't worth it i can't think of a perfecter way to word it
than to just say that i love y'all too much to see the verdict
i'll walk away from it all 'fore i let it go any further
but don't get it twisted it's not a plea that i'm coppin'
i'm just willin' to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'
off at the jaws well then i can 'cause frankly i'm sick of talkin'
i'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience
'cause
y'all act like you never seen a white person before
jaws all on the floor like pam like tommy just burst in the door
and started whoopin' her ass worse than before
they first were divorced suin' her over furniture agh
it's the return of the ah wait no way you're kidding
he didn't just say what i think he did did he
and dr dre said nothing you idiots
dr dre's dead he's locked in my basement ha ha
feminist women love eminem
chicka chicka chicka slim shady i'm sick of him
look at him walkin' around grabbin' his youknowwhat
flippin' the youknowwho yeah but he's so cute though
yeah i probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
but no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
sometimes i wanna get on tv and just let loose
but can't but it's cool for tom green to hump a dead moose
my bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips
and if i'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
and that's the message that we deliver to little kids
and expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
by the time they hit fourth grade
they've got the discovery channel don't they
we ain't nothin' but mammalswell some of us cannibals
who cut other people open like cantaloupes
but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
but if you feel like i feel i got the antidote
women wave your pantyhose sing the chorus and it goes
will smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records nope
well i do so fuck him and fuck you too
you think i give a damn about a grammy
half of you critics can't even stomach me let alone stand me
but slim what if you win wouldn't it be weird
why so you guys could just lie to get me here
so you can sit me here next to britney spears
shit christina aguilera better switch me chairs
so i can sit next to carson daly and fred durst
and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
little bitch put me on blast on mtv
yeah he's cute but i think he's married to kim heehee
i should download her audio on mp3
and show the whole world how you gave eminem vd agh
i'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
all you do is annoy me so i have been sent here to destroy you
and there's a million of us just like me
who cuss like me who just don't give a fuck like me
who dress like me walk talk and act like me
and just might be the next best thing but not quite me
i'm like a head trip to listen to cause i'm only givin' you
things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
the only difference is i got the balls to say it in front of y'all
and i don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
i just get on the mic and spit it
and whether you like to admit it i just shit it
better than 90 of you rappers out can
then you wonder how can
kids eat up these albums like valiums
it's funny cause at the rate i'm going when i'm 30
i'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
pinching nurse's asses when i'm jacking off with jergens
and i'm jerking but this whole bag of viagra isn't working
and every single person is a slim shady lurking
he could be working at burger king spittin' on your onion rings
or in the parking lot circling screaming i don't give a fuck
with his windows down and his system up
so will the real shady please stand up
and put one of those fingers on each hand up
and be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
and one more time loud as you can how does it go
hailie i know you miss your mom and i know you miss your dad
when i'm gone but i'm tryin' to give you the life that i never had
i can see you're sad even when you smile even when you laugh
i can see it in your eyes deep inside you wanna cry
'cause you're scared i ain't there
daddy's with you in your prayers
no more cryin' wipe them tears
daddy's here no more nightmares
we gon' pull together through it
we gon' do it lainieuncle's crazy ain't he
yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
we're all we got in this world when it spins when it swirls
when it whirls when it twirls two little beautiful girls
lookin' puzzled in a daze i know it's confusin' you
daddy's always on the move momma's always on the news
i try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
the harder that i try to do that the more it backfires on me
all the things growin' up as daddy that he had to see
daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
we did not plan it to be this way your mother and me
but things have got so bad between us i don't see us ever bein'
together ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
but then of course everything always happens for a reason
i guess it was never meant to be but it's just something
we have no control over and that's what destiny is
but no more worries rest your head and go to sleep
maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream
it's funny i remember back one year when daddy had no money
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
and said some of 'em were from me 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
i'll never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night cryin'
'cause daddy felt like a bumsee daddy had a job
but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
and at the time every house that we lived in
either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
and your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
and it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
on to chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on novara
and that's when daddy went to california with his cd
and met dr dre and flew you and momma out to see me
but daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me
then you started seein' daddy on the tv and momma didn't like it
and you and lainie were too young to understand it
papa was a rolling stone momma developed a habit
and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
i'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud
now i'm sittin' in this empty house
just reminiscin' lookin' at your baby pictures it just trips me out
to see how much you both have grown it's almost like you're sisters now
wow guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
lainie i'm talkin' to you too daddy's still here
i like the sound of that yeah it's got a ring to it don't it
sshh momma's only gone for the moment
alright stop huh
now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
and try to get money out the drawer
you better think of the consequence who are you
i'm your motherfuckin' conscience
that's nonsense
go in gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
and borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
can i borrow this
tell her you need a place to stay you'll be safe for days
if you shave your legs with renee's razor blades
yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
the whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
think about it before you walk in the door first
look at the store clerk she's older than george burns
fuck that do that shit shoot that bitch
can you afford to blow this shit are you that rich
why you give a fuck if she dies are you that bitch
do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids
man don't do it it's not worth it to risk it you're right
not over this shit stop
drop the biscuit i will
don't even listen to slim yo he's bad for you
you know what dre i don't like your attitude
now listen to me while you're kissin' her cheek
and smearin' her lipstick slip this in her drink
now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
yo this girl's only fifteen years old
you shouldn't take advantage of her it's not fair
yo look at her bush does it got hair uhhuh

but think about the baby before you get all crazy
okay thought about it still wanna stab her

that's what i did be smart don't be a retard

how in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent
'cause he don't need to go the same route that i went
been there done that
aw fuck it what am i sayin'
shoot 'em both grady where's your gun at
have you ever been hated or discriminated against
i have i've been protested and demonstrated against
picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times
sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
all this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
not takin' nothin' from no one give 'em hell long as i'm breathin'
keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
see they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out
look at me now i bet you're prob'ly sick of me now
ain't you mama i'ma make you look so ridiculous now
i got some skeletons in my closet
and i don't know if no one knows it
so before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
i'ma expose it i'll take you back to '73
before i ever had a multiplatinumselling cd
i was a baby maybe i was just a couple of months
my faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
cause he split i wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
no i don't on second thought i just fuckin' wished he would die
i look at hailie and i couldn't picture leavin' her side
even if i hated kim i'd grit my teeth and i'd try
to make it work with her at least for hailie's sake
i maybe made some mistakes
but i'm only human but i'm man enough to face 'em today
what i did was stupid no doubt it was dumb
but the smartest shit i did was take the bullets out of that gun
cause i'da killed 'em shit i woulda shot kim and him both
it's my life i'd like to welcome y'all to the eminem show
now i would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
but put yourself in my position just try to envision
witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
goin' through public housing systems
victim of mnchausen's syndrome
my whole life i was made to believe i was sick when i wasn't
'til i grew up now i blew up
it makes you sick to your stomach doesn't it
wasn't it the reason you made that cd for me ma
so you could try to justify the way you treated me ma
but guess what you're gettin' older now
and it's cold when you're lonely
and nathan's growin' up so quick
he's gonna know that you're phony
and hailie's gettin' so big now you should see her she's beautiful
but you'll never see her she won't even be at your funeral haha
see what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
bitch do your song keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom
but how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
you selfish bitch i hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
remember when ronnie died and you said you wished it was me
well guess what i am dead dead to you as can be
come here little kiddies on my lap
guess who's back with a brand new rap
and i don't mean rap as in a new case
of child molestation accusations
ahahahahah no worries
papa's got a brand new bag of toys
what else could i possibly do to make noise
i done touched on everything but little boys
and that's not a stab at michael
that's just a metaphor i'm just psycho
i go a little bit crazy sometimes
i get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
good god dip do a little slide
bend down touch your toes and just glide
up the center of the dance floor
like tp for my bunghole
and it's cool if you let one go
nobody's gonna know who'd hear it
give a little pootpoot it's okay
oops my cd just skipped
and everyone just heard you let one rip
'scuse me miss i don't mean to sound like a jerk
but i'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
spit on me maybe gouge my eyes out yeah
now what's your name girl what's your sign
man you must be up out your mind
dre ahah beer goggles blind
i'm just tryin' to unwind now i'm

it's your chance for a little romance or
butt squeezin' it's the season
just go ahahahah so appeasin'
have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for
not the expression no literally give an arm for
when they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
and you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
but what happens when karma turns right around to bite you
and everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
what happens when you become the main source of her pain
daddy look what i made dad's gotta go catch a plane

animals having sex with 'em camels mammals and rabbits

smoke weed take pills drop out of school kill people
and drink jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
i'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal

some people only see that i'm white ignorin' skill
'cause i stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
but i don't get pissed y'all don't even see through the mist
how the fuck can i be white i don't even exist
i get a clean shave bathe go to a rave
die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
my middle finger won't go down how do i wave
and this is how i'm supposed to teach kids how to behave
me and marcus allen went over to see nicole
when we heard a knock at the door must've been ron gold
jumped behind the door put the orgy on hold
killed them both then smeared blood on the white bronco
we did it my mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
i slapped garth brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
i'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer
that'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
my rap style's warped i'm runnin' out the morgue
with your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
jumped in a chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
and beat up foghorn leghorn with an acorn
i'm 'bout as normal as norman bates with deformative traits
a premature birth that was four minutes late
mother are you there i love you
i never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel that shovel
will someone please explain to my brain
that i just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and i'm in pain
i take a breather and sigh either i'm high or i'm nuts
'cause if you ain't tiltin' this room neither am i
so when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
then it probably is obvious i got it on with her
'cause when i drop this solo shit it's over with

blood guts guns cuts
knives lives wives nuns sluts

the mother did drugs hard liquor cigarettes and speed
the baby came out disfigured ligaments indeed
it was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
don't dare make fun of that baby 'cause that baby was me
i'm a criminal an animal caged who turned crazed
but how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised
so as i got older and i got a lot taller
my dick shrunk smaller but my balls got larger
i drank more liquor to fuck you up quicker
than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word
my morals went thhbbpp when the president got oral
sex in his oval office on top of his desk off of his own employee
now don't ignore me you won't avoid me
you can't miss me i'm white blondehaired and my nose is pointy
i'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
in plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happenin' to him
slim shady i'm as crazy as em
inem and kim combined the maniac's in
in place of the doctor 'cause dre couldn't make it today
he's a little under the weather so i'm takin' his place mmmmmmm
oh that's dre with an ak to his face
don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
i told you dre you should've kept that thang put away
i guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it eh
i'm a criminal
windows tinted on my ride when i drive in it go go go
so when i rob a bank run out and just dive in it
so i'll be disguised in it and if anybody identifies
the guy in it i hide for five minutes
come back shoot the eyewitness
fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
die bitches bastards brats pets
this puppy's lucky i didn't blast his ass yet
if i ever gave a fuck i'd shave my nuts

to make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
and if it's not a rapper that i make it as
i'ma be a fuckin' rapist in a jason mask
motherfuckers say that i'm foolish i only talk about jewels bling bling
do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it
see i'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
the same dude you gave nothin' i made somethin' doin'
what i do through and through and
i give you the news with a twist it's just his ghetto point of view
the renegade you been afraid i penetrate pop culture
bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
and they live with they moms got dropped roadsters
from botched robberies niggas crouched over
mami's knocked up cause she wasn't watched over
knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
no he's not around now how that sound to ya jot it down
i bring you through the ghetto without ridin' round
hidin' down duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
just read a magazine that fucked up my day
how you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it
i help them see they way through itnot you
can't step in my pants can't walk in my shoes
bet everything you worth you'll lose your tie and your shirt
since i'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
i ain't no politician but i'll kick it with 'em a minute
cause see they call me a menace and if the shoe fits i'll wear it
but if it don't then y'all will swallow the truth grin and bear it
now who's the king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
who could inherit the title put the youth in hysterics
usin' his music to steer it sharin' his views and his merits
but there's a huge interference they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
maybe it's hatred i spew maybe it's food for the spirit
maybe it's beautiful music i made for you to just cherish
but i'm debated disputed hated and viewed in america
as a motherfuckin' drug addict like you didn't experiment
nah nahthat's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrassed
and i got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
you fuckin' dogooders too bad you couldn't do good at marriage haha
and do you have any clue what i had to do to get here
i don't think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
cause here we go he's jiggajurjiggajihjigga
and i'm the sinister mr kissmyass is just a
i had to hustle my back to the wall ashy knuckles
pockets filled with a lotta lint not a cent
gotta vent lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
what you hollerin' gotta pay rent bring dollars in
by the bodega iron under my coat
feelin' braver durag wrappin' my waves up pockets full of hope
do not step to me i'm awkward i box lefty
an orphan my pops left me and often my momma wasn't home
could not stress to me i wasn't grown
'specially on nights i brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
my demeanor thirty years my senior
my childhood didn't mean much only raisin' green up
raisin' my fingers to critics raisin' my head to the sky
big i did it multi before i die
no lie just know i chose my own fate
i drove by the fork in the road and went straight
see i'm a poet to some a regular modernday shakespeare
jesus christ the king of these latterday saints here
to shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
a monger of hate satanist scatterbrained atheist
but that ain't the case see it's a matter of taste
we as a people decide if shady's as bad as they say he is
or is he the latter a gateway to escape
media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
see it's as easy as cake simple as whistlin' dixie
while i'm wavin' the pistol at sixty christians against me
go to war with the mormons take a bath with the catholics
in holy water no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
i'm a motherfuckin' spiteful delightful eyeful
the new ice cube motherfuckers hate to like you
what did i do huh i'm just a kid from the gutter
makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers cause i'm a muh'fuckin'
slim shady brain dead like jim brady
i'm a m80 you little like that kim lady

my name is marshall mathers i'm an alcoholic hi marshall
i have a disease and they don't know what to call it

bought a ticket to yo' concert just to come and whip yo' ass
bitch i'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make yo' eyes spin
you gettin' knocked the fuck out like mike tyson pssh
the proof is in the puddin' just ask deshaun holton
i'll slit yo' motherfuckin' throat worse than ron goldman
i'm nicer than pete but i'm on a search to crush a milkbone
i'm everlastin' i melt vanilla ice like silicone
i'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
i'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
flavor with no seasoning this is the sneak preview
i'll diss yo' magazine and still won't get a weak review
i'll make yo' freak leave you smell the folgers crystals
this is lyrical combat gentlemen hold your pistols
but i form like voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
slim shady mm was the old initials byebye
extortion snortin' supportin' abortion
pathological liar blowin' shit outta proportion
the looniest zaniest spontaneous sporadic
impulsive thinker compulsive drinker addict
half animal half man
dumpin' yo' dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
with more holes than an afghan
somebody let me out this limousine hey let me out
i'm a caged demon
on stage screamin' like rage against the machine
i'm convinced i'm a fiend
shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
clinically braindead i don't need a second opinion
fuck droppin' a jewel i'm flippin' a sacred treasure
i'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher
i can't take the pressure i'm sick of bitches
sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while i'm washin' dishes
in school i never said much too busy havin' a head rush
doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
then i went to jim beam that's when my face grayed
went to gym in eighth grade  the women's swim team
don't take me for a joke i'm no comedian
too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
i'm goin' up over the curb drivin' on the median
finally made it home but i don't got the key to get in
momma had a baby and its head popped off
head popped off head popped off head popped off head popped off head popped off
but momma don't want me the next thing i know i'm gettin' dropped off
gettin' dropped off gettin' dropped off gettin' dropped off gettin' dropped off
ringringring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors on their front porch
their front porch their front porch their front porch their front porch
but they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn
else's lawn else's lawn else's lawn
'til somebody finally took me in my great aunt and uncle edna and charles
edna and charles edna and charles edna and charles edna and charles they were the ones who were left in charge
my elementary they'd gang up on me and sing this song
sing this song sing this song sing this song sing this song
it went a little something like
mary had a little lamb little lamb little lamb
debbie had a satan spawn satan spawn
momma why do they keep sayin' this i just don't understand understand
and by the way where's my dad
predominantly predominantly everything's always predominantly
predominantlywhite predominantly black well what about me
where does that leave me well i guess that i'm between predominantly both of 'em
i think if i hear that fuckin' word again i'ma scream
while i'm projectile vomitin' what do i look like a comedian to you
do you think that i'm kiddin' what do i look like some kinda idi
wait a minute shit don't answer that why am i so misunderstood
why do i go through so much bullshit it's such bullshit it's tush mull bish
woe is me there goes poor marshall again whinin' about his millions
and his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
and the dad that he never had and how his childhood was so bad
and how his mom was a dope addict and his exwife how they go at it
man i'd hate to have it as bad as that mr mathers claims he had it
i can't imagine it that little rich poor white bastard
needs to take some of that cash out of the bank and take a bath in it
man if i only had half of it
shit if you only knew the half of it
haha
evil deeds while i plant these evil seeds
please release me from these demons
i never had any of this shit planned mom please believe
i don't wanna be satan's spawn
never got the chance to say i'm sorry
now look at all the pain i caused
dear santa claus why are you not comin' this year again
what did i do that was so bad to deserve this
everything could have been so perfect
but life ain't a fairytale i'm about to be hoisted up in the air
forty feet below me there's people everywhere
i don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause i'm in this ferris wheel
and all i wanna do is go to the mall and take hailie on the carousel
without this crowd everywhere i go but life is like a merrygoround
here we go now dosido now curtains up the show must go now
ringaroundtherosie the show's over you can all go home now
but the curtain just don't close for me this ain't how fame was supposed to be
where's the switch i could just turn offandon this ain't what i chose to be
so please god give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'til i pass 50 back the baton the camera's on my soul is gone
there's not much you could do or say to phase me
people think i'm a little bit crazy
i get it from all angles even occasionally doc drezie
will have to step in every once in a while to save me
to make me stop and think about it 'fore i just say things
sometimes i forget what other people just may think
a lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
if they heard some shit i'd lay the tape 'fore they erased me
i may be a little too fastpaced and racy
sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
twenty times 'cause i say so many rhymes it may seem
like i'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing
and i could give a fuck what category you place me
long as when i'm pushing up daisies
and gone as long as you place me amongst one of them greats
when i hit the heavenly gates i'll be cool beside jayz
for every single diehard fan who embraced me
i'm thankful for the talent in which god gave me
and i'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
believe it or not i thank my mom for how she raised me
in the neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
it only made me what i am today see
regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
you ain't gonna make or break me
tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake g
you're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
'cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
and when you face me with all the shit you've been saving
to say to me you had all this time to think about it
now don't pussy out and try to about face me
'cause i've been patiently waiting for the day
that we finally meet in the same place to see
my flow's untouchable now you gotta face it
uh oh it gets worse when i go back to the basics
you gon' say the wrong shit and get your whole face split
the smell of victory love it so much i can taste it
i spot my target blaze it direct hit
graze it your peace talk save it
your shit sounds dated you're overrated
i'm obligated to study your moves then crush you motherfuckers
if i'm the best and the worst then god's gift is a curse
soldier trained to destroy  you payin' attention boy
i spit shit slick shit so quick you miss it
to be specific i go ballistic as hieroglyphic
my music is a drug press play you ain't gotta sniff it
shoot it or pop it roll it bag it or chop it
it'll get you high over and over but you gotta cop it
when it's hot it's hot your hatin' is undeniable stop it
all right come on let's cut the bullshit enough
let's get it started let's start addressin' this issue and open it up
let's take this shit back to the basement and we can discuss
statements that's made on this tape and its whole origin of
the music that we all know and love the music we all enjoy
the music you accuse me of tryin' to destroy
let's rewind it to '89 when i was a boy
on the east side of detroit crossin' 8 mile into warren
into hick territory i'd like to share a story
this is my story and can't nobody tell it for me
you have well informed me i am wellaware
that i don't belong here you've made that perfectly clear
i get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
from belaire shopping center just for stoppin' in there
from the black side all the way to the white side
okay there's a bright side a day that i might slide
you may call it a pass i call it haulin' my ass
through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
oh them railroad tracks them old railroad tracks
them good old notorious so well known tracks
my first year in 9th grade can't forget that day at school
it was cool 'til your man mc shan came through
he said that puma's the brand cause the klan makes troops
it was rumors but man goddamn they flew
musta been true because man we done banned they shoes
i had the new ones the cool j ice lamb suede too
but we just threw 'em in the trash like they yesterday's news
guess who came through next x clan debuted
professor x vanglorious
exist in a state of red black and green with a key sissies
now with this bein' the new trend we don't fit in
crackas is out with cactus albums blackness is in
african symbols and medallions represent black power
and we ain't know what it meant me and my man howard
and butter would go to the mall
with 'em all over our necks like we're showin' 'em off
not knowin' at all we was bein' laughed at
you ain't even half black
you ain't 'posed to have that homie let me grab that
and that flavor flav clock we gon' have to snatch that
all i remember is meetin' back at
manix's basement sayin' how we hate this
how racist but dope the x clan's tape is
which reminds me back in '89 me
and kim broke up for the first time she was tryin' to twotime me
and there was this black girl at our school who thought i was cool
cause i rapped so she was kinda eyein' me
and oh the irony guess what her name was
ain't even gonna say it plus
the same color hair as hers was and blue contacts
and a pair of jugs the bombest goddamn girl in our whole school
if i could pull her not only would i become more popular
but i would be able to piss kim off at the same time
but it backfired
i was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
and that's the last i ever seen or heard
or spoke to the ole foolish pride girl but i've heard
people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
but it was i singled out a whole race
and for that i apologize i was wrong
cause no matter what color a girl is she's still a
i'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
i ain't never supposed to show it
my crew ain't supposed to know it
even if it means goin' toetotoe with a benzino
it don't matter i never drag 'em in battles that i can't handle
'less i absolutely have to i'm supposed to set an example
i need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide 'em
if some shit ever does pop off i'm supposed to be beside 'em
that ja shit i tried to squash it it was too late to stop it
there's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
i heard him say hailie's name on a song and i just lost it
it was crazy the shit went way beyond some jayz and nas shit
and even though the battle was won i feel like we lost it
i spent so much energy on it honestly i'm exhausted
and i'm so caught in it that i almost feel i'm the one who caused it
this ain't what i'm in hiphop for that's not why i got in it
that was never my object for someone to get killed
why would i wanna destroy something i helped build
that wasn't my intentions my intentions were good
i went through my whole career without ever mentionin'
and that was just outta respect for not runnin' my mouth
and talkin' about somethin' that i knew nothin' about
plus dre told me stay out this just wasn't my beef
so i did i just fell back watched and gritted my teeth
while he's all over tv downtalkin' the man
who literally saved my life like fuck it i understand
this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
but still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute 'cause
there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
but now it's elevated 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
the shit gets escalatedit ain't just words no more is it
it's a different ballgame you call names and you ain't just rappin'
we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happenin'
me and dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
and asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
until ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
fuck it 50 smash him mash on him let him have it
meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk
has an erection for me and thinks that i'll be his resurrection
tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
but now he's fucked the game up
'cause one of the ways i came up
was through that publication the same one that made me famous
now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
well fuck it that motherfucker could get it too fuck him then
but i'm so busy bein' pissed off i don't stop to think
that we just inherited 50's beef with murder inc
and he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
but we still have soldiers that's on the front line
who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
never to extort us strictly to show they support us
and maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
to show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important
it is to have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners
their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
but i ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
it ain't worth it i can't think of a perfecter way to word it
than to just say that i love y'all too much to see the verdict
i'll walk away from it all 'fore i let it go any further
but don't get it twisted it's not a plea that i'm coppin'
i'm just willin' to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'
off at the jaws well then i can 'cause frankly i'm sick of talkin'
i'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience
'cause
i was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
but off of the dome would probably be a little more
more suitable for this type of song whoa
i got a million reasons off the top of my head that i could think of
sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink to
so fuck it i'ma start right here i'll just be brief i'm
'bout to rattle off some of the reasons
i knew i shouldn't go and get another tattoo
of you on my arm but what do i go and do
i go and get another one now i got two oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
now i'm sitting here with your name on my skin
i can't believe i went and did this stupid shit again
my next girlfriend now her name's gotta be kim shiiiiiiit
if you only knew how much i hated you
for every motherfucking thing you've ever put us through
then i wouldn't be standing here crying over you boooooooooooohoo
i was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
but i thought a song would probably be a little better
instead of a letter that you'd probably just shred up yeah
i stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
how much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to a stupid piece of
paper i'd rather let you see how
much i fucking hate you in a freestyle
you're a fucking cokehead slut i hope you fucking die

erierierick swallowed some generic sleeping pills
and woke up in bed next to his best friend derrick barenaked
jigajigjijijanean just turned 16 and used a fake id
to sneak in vip to see r kelly
heeheeheeheeheehee to be so young and nave
oh what i wouldn't give to live so kim and carefree
paris and nicky's parents must be so tickled they cherish
every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
hickorydickory dirk diggler look at me work wizardry
with these words  am i a jerk or just jerk chicken
or chigachiggachigchigjerchigjer jerkin' your chain
twentytwo jerks in a jerk circle or is it a circle jerk
wait a minute what am i sayin' allow me to run it back
and rewind it blblblblblblblb  wait let me ask you again
am i just jerkin' your chain am i berserk or insane
or am i just one of them damn amateurs workin' the dang
cameras filmin' one of them paris hilton homemade
pornos who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle
jiggajijust recently somebody just discovered
britney and justin videotapes of 'em fuckin'
when they was just mouseketeers in the mickey mouse club
and dusted 'em and went straight to the source with 'em
'cause they could've sworn someone said ni
and then tried to erase and record over it
but if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
gahu and then they come to
find out it was justin sayin' i'm gonnuh cum
any opinions or somethin' you just wanna get off your chest
and address it about my lyrics i'd love to hear it
all you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
it's 1800i'madicksuckeri'dlovetosuckadick
and if someone picks up
you can talk all the shit you want about me
just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
and i'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day
that i fall out with dre wake up gay and make up with ray hey
so fuck a chicken lick a chicken suck a chicken beat a chicken
eat a chicken like it's a big cock bigabigcock
or suck a dick and lick a dick and eat a dick and stick a dick in your mouth
i'm done you can fuck off fuckafuckoff
you find me offensive
i find you offensive for finding me offensive
hence if i should draw out or line any fences
if so to what extent if any should i go
'cause it's getting expensive
being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
they say i cause extensive
psychological nerve damage to the brain
when i go to lengths this far at other people's expenses
i say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
it's censorship and it's downright blasphemous
let's end this shit now 'cause i won't stand for this
and christopher reeves won't sit for this neither
and let's clear this up too i ain't got no beef with him either
he used to be like a hero to me i even believe i
had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
right next to darth vader
and darth must've put a hex on him for later
i feel like it's my fault 'cause of the way that
i stuck him up in between him and lex luthor
i killed superman i killed superman
and how ironic
that i'd be the bad guy kryptonite the green chronic
now in the bible it says
thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed
have homosexual sex
unless of course you were given the consent to join in
then of course it's intercourse and it's bisexual sex
which isn't as bad
long as you show some remorse for your actions
either before during or after
performing the act of that which
is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases
that are more used by today's kids in a more derogatory way
but who's to say what's fair to say and what not to say
let's ask dr dre
dr dre what up i got a question if i may yeah
is it gay to play puttputt golf with a friend yeah
and watch his butt butt when he tees off yeah
but but i ain't done yet
in football the quarterback yells out huthut
while he reaches in another grown man's ass
grabs on his nuts but just what if
it was never meant it was just an accident
but he tripped fell slipped and his penis went in
his teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
but his little weenie flinched just a little bit
and i don't need to go into any more details but
what if he pictured it as a female's butt
is that gay i just need to clear things up
'til then i'll just walk around with a manly strut because
you find me offensive i find you offensive
shit this is the same verse i just did this
when am i gonna come to my good senses
probably the day bush comes to my defenses
my spider sense is telling me spiderman is nearby
and my plan is to get him next
and open up a whoop ass canister
goddammit dre where's the goddamn beat yeah
anyway anyway i don't know how else to put it
this is the only thing that i'm good at
i am the bad guy kryptonite the green chronic
demonic yup yup don't worry i'm on it
i got it highfive nick lachey
stuck a pin in jessica's head and walked away
and as she flew around the room like a balloon i
grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can
and zoomed i headed straight back to the neverland ranch
with a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich
and i ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense
i just did a whole song and i didn't say shit
scrutinize every word memorize every line
i spit it once refuel reenergize and rewind
i give sight to the blind my insight through the mind
i exercise my right to express when i feel it's time
it's just all in your mind what you interpret it as
i say to fight you take it as i'ma whip someone's ass
and if you don't understand don't even bother to ask
a father who has grown up with a fatherless past
who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
or at least shows no difficulty multitaskin'
and juggling both perhaps mastered his craft slash
entrepreneur who's helped launch a few more rap acts
who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
of his career typical manure movin' past that
mr kisshisasscrack he's a class act
rubber band man yeah he just snaps back
all the people up top on the side and the middle
come together let's all form and swarm just a little
just let it gradually build from the front to the back
all you can see is a sea of people some white and some black
don't matter what color all that matters we're gathered together
to celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
if it rains let it rain yeah the wetter the better
they ain't gon' stop us they can't we're stronger now more than ever
they tell us no we say yeah they tell us stop we say go
rebel with a rebel yell raise hell we gon' let 'em know
stomp push shove mush fuck bush
until they bring our troops home come on just
imagine it pourin' just rainin' down on us
moshpits outside the oval office
someone's tryna tell us somethin' maybe this is god just
sayin' we're responsible for this monster this coward
that we have empowered this is bin laden
look at his head noddin'
how could we allow somethin' like this without pumpin' our fists
now this is our final hour
let me be the voice and your strength and your choice
let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
try to amplify it times it and multiply it by six
'teen million people all equal at this high pitch
maybe we can reach alqaeda through my speech
let the president answer a higher anarchy
strap him with an ak47 let him go
fight his own war let him impress daddy that way
no more blood for oil
we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
no more psychological warfare
to trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
if we don't serve our own country we're patronizin' a hero
look in his eyes it's all lies
the stars and stripes have been swiped washed out and wiped
and replaced with his own face mosh now or die
if i get sniped tonight you'll know why
'cause i told you to fight
alright listen i need you to focus
i need you to go dig deep in your mind this is important
we are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
i'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
now i need you to open your mind your eyes close 'em
you are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
for the next four and a half minutes we are going to explore
into your mind to find out why you're so fucking jealous
now why did they make yoohoo pippitykakapoopoo
psych i'm kidding i just wanted to see if you're still listening
okay now i need your undivided attention
sir i have a question why do i always sense this undeniable tension
from the moment that i enter into the room it gets all quiet and whispers
whenever there's conversation why am i always mentioned
i've been dying to ask it's been itching at me is it just because
alright now i shit i just flubbed a line
i was going to say something extremely important
but i forgot who or what it was i fucked up
psych i'm kidding again you idiot no i didn't
that's just what you wanted to hear from me is that i fucked up ain't it
but i can bust one take without looking at no paper
it doesn't take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day
for me to say the truth okay you're drooling you have tooth decay
your mouth is open you're disgusting what the fuck you eat for lunch
a bunch of sweets or something what you munch a bunch of crunch 'n munch
your tooth is rotten to the gum your breath stinks wanna chew some gum
yes i do sir what am i on you sir are on truth serum
marshall i'm so jealous of you please say you won't tell nobody
i'd be so embarrassed i'm just absolutely terrified
that someone's gonna find out why i'm saying all these terrible
evil and awful mean things it's my own insecurities
alright now we we're going to conduct
that experiment that we were talking about earlier
just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
'cause that's exactly what your eyes look like wanna check to see
here's a mirror notice the resemblance here
wait let me put these sunglasses on now look in this mirror
how 'bout now what do you have in common
you're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
you look like i sound like singing about weenies
now take my weenie out of your mouth
this is between me and you i know you're not happy
i know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
curled up in a ball tweaked out of my mind dying there's no denying
that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
why are you even doing this to yourself it's pointless
why do we have to keep on going through this this is torturous
my point is this
that if you say mean things your weenie will shrink
now i forgot what the chorus is you're just as
i never woulda thought that i'd see you out of control
even though my penis was deep down in your hole
you should know between us we was like mates of soul
nothin' could intervene us especially no hoes
you was more so the chalant type i chose
'til more shows haunted you nights i suppose
that's how it go with time spent emotion grows
in the beginning friends we decided to roll
so who's responsible when you get excited explode
and obie's grinnin' then you invite that obie's cold
but bitches they gon' talk niggas they gon' hate
we established this way before we became mates
so what's required is that you chill with all that fire
get your desire when i retire and
i used to say i never met a girl like you before
still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
almost went as far as introducin' you to my daughters
'til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
now i just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
can't believe i almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
you used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
all i ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
if you recall i used to treat you like a groupie broad
when we fucked i refused to even take my jewelry off
but it threw me off the first time i called and you blew me off
it was a shock it struck me as odd but it turned me on
you started gettin' moody on me pretty soon we'd argue
and the ruder you got the more beautiful you got to me
and who'da even knew that who would'a even thought possibly
cupid could shoot another one of them goddamn darts at me
it's true that i got shot in the heart
but when someone seems too good to be true they usually are
but see when you're in it it's too hard to see
'til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
before you make a decision that's lifealtering
and just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
you hear them words echoing almost haunting that taunting ring
in most cases stat's attitude is fuck a bitch
my only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
but you was different thought we shared a covenant
even held your hand in pubalic
we sufferin' because of this
shawty on some whole 'nother other shit
tryin' to play slick thinkin' i'ma trick off grip
i'll admit i was caught in the mix down to commit
feedin' you the best of me i should've fed you piss
we started off closer than close
but who could've predicted to know
your trifling ways would'a stopped our growth
and the final result back in that same boat
i asked myself do i love these hoes  nope
yeah em introduced us 50 this is tanya tanya this is 50
then slid off and left her to kick it with me
i complimented her i said you have very nice lips
with my imagination i could see her suckin' my dick
we played the phone game a week later shit changed fast
had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
downtown manhattan on the balcony stare at the skyline
penthouse full of imported shit you know how i grind
she got to talkin' talkin' like an opportunist too
why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move
said she's an aspiring actress she do videos for practice
yeah yeah know how many times i done heard that shit haha
hailie i know you miss your mom and i know you miss your dad
when i'm gone but i'm tryin' to give you the life that i never had
i can see you're sad even when you smile even when you laugh
i can see it in your eyes deep inside you wanna cry
'cause you're scared i ain't there
daddy's with you in your prayers
no more cryin' wipe them tears
daddy's here no more nightmares
we gon' pull together through it
we gon' do it lainieuncle's crazy ain't he
yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
we're all we got in this world when it spins when it swirls
when it whirls when it twirls two little beautiful girls
lookin' puzzled in a daze i know it's confusin' you
daddy's always on the move momma's always on the news
i try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
the harder that i try to do that the more it backfires on me
all the things growin' up as daddy that he had to see
daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
we did not plan it to be this way your mother and me
but things have got so bad between us i don't see us ever bein'
together ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
but then of course everything always happens for a reason
i guess it was never meant to be but it's just something
we have no control over and that's what destiny is
but no more worries rest your head and go to sleep
maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream
it's funny i remember back one year when daddy had no money
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
and said some of 'em were from me 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
i'll never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night cryin'
'cause daddy felt like a bumsee daddy had a job
but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
and at the time every house that we lived in
either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
and your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
and it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
on to chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on novara
and that's when daddy went to california with his cd
and met dr dre and flew you and momma out to see me
but daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me
then you started seein' daddy on the tv and momma didn't like it
and you and lainie were too young to understand it
papa was a rolling stone momma developed a habit
and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
i'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud
now i'm sittin' in this empty house
just reminiscin' lookin' at your baby pictures it just trips me out
to see how much you both have grown it's almost like you're sisters now
wow guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
lainie i'm talkin' to you too daddy's still here
i like the sound of that yeah it's got a ring to it don't it
sshh momma's only gone for the moment
can't you see what you do to me baby
you make me crazy you make me act like a maniac
i'm like a lunatic you make me sick
you're truly the only one who can do this to me
you just make me get so crazy
i go schizo i get so insane i just go schizophrenic
one minute i wanna slit your throat the next i wanna sex
you make me crazy the way we act
like two maniacs in the sack
we fuck like two jackrabbits
and maybe that's a bad habit
'cause the next day we're right back at it
in the same exact pattern
what the fuck is the matter with us
we can't figure out if it's lust or it's love
what's that that's attractin' us to each other
they say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch
but i stay and still stick it out with you
even though i just hit you today
but you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
just 'cause i came home late last night
crawled in bed and i woke you
but if there's one thing about you that i admire it's baby
because you stay with me maybe 'cause you're as crazy as i am
'cause when i look at you i can see an angel in your eyes
but if i look deeper inside i see your freakish little side
like a devil in disguise you're always full of surprises
always pullin' devices out your purse little vibrators and dildoes
you fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
you're only 24 but you're plenty more mature
than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
like they're in middle school still
you're crazy sexy cool chill
and you play your position you never step outta line
even though i stay in your business you've always kept outta mine
i wonder what's on your mind
sometimes they say love is blind
maybe that's why the first time
i dotted your eye you ain't see the sign
or maybe you did maybe you like being shoved
maybe 'cause we're crazy in love
you are the ink to my paper what my pen is to my pad
the moral the very fiber the whole substance to my rap
you are my reason for being the meaning of my existence
if it wasn't for you i would never be able to spit this
as intense as i do and the irony is you rely on me
as much as i rely on you to inspire me like you do
you provide me the lighter fluid the fuel to my fire
you're my entire supply gas the match and igniter
the only way that i am able to stay so stable
is you're the legs to my table
if you were to break i'd fall on my face
but i'm always gonna make you feel i don't need you as much
as i really need you so you don't use it to your advantage
but you're essential to me you're the air i breathe i believe
if you ever leave me i'd probably have no reason to be
you are the kim to my marshall you're the slim to my shady
the dre to my eminem the alaina to my hailie
you are the word that i'm lookin' for
when i'm tryin' to describe how i feel inside
and the right one just won't come to my mind
you're like the pillar that props me up the beam that supports me
the bitch who never took half the wife who never divorced me
you're like the root to my evil you let my devil come out me
you let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me
and no matter how much too much is never enough
maybe 'cause we're crazy in love
security's gone i'm trapped in the club
and i'm trying to run and get my motherfucking gun
nigga what about yo' wife nigga fuck my wife
i'm trying to run and save my motherfucking life
oh shit the shooter's coming

people are still camped out from the night before
sleeping outside the door waiting in line still
trying to get inside the club to see d12 perform
the fire marshals know the venue's too small
people are wall to wall 3000 and some odd
fans and some cumwad from out the parking lot
gets in an argument over a parking spot
decides to pull his gun out and lets a few of them off
missed who he's aiming for six feet aways the door
into st andrew's hall now the strays flying all over the place
grazed one bitch in the face
another one of 'em came through the wall
before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
i'm posted up at the bar having a mazel tov
bullet whizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
thank god i'm alive i gotta find denaun

the buzz is tremendous we drop you all to sense it
i dont gotta' promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches

doc is this doc is that you got the wrong impression
you must be on the cock of doc cause doc left you all guessin
so dj take the needle and just drop it on the record what
we gon have this motherfucker hoppin in a second bump bump
thats why we always save the best cut last
to make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
cause we done swam with the sharks wrestled with alligators
spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
whom if it wasnt for rap to bridge the gap may be raised to be racist
who may have never got to see our faces
graced the cover of rolling stone pages
broke down barriers of language and races
just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and dre
to pass the mic and we can play the
back and forth all day like the hot potato game
thats why we came to
bounce now hands up you know how we do
we make the club jump everywhere we go
its no secret everybody know
when dres involved theres plenty of money involved
and plenty honeys involved and sunny sundays and palm trees
cali everyday is just another party
from the valleys all the way to them 8 mile alleys
lets rally hands up for the grand finale
now raise up out your seat dres about to speak
blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
you can catch me in the studio bangin out the beats to
provide you with the heat that keep blazing out your speakers
so never say never cause shady aftermath together
along with gunit records presents the return of the
the doc and shady no one can do it better
we tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence that a
come here little kiddies on my lap
guess who's back with a brand new rap
and i don't mean rap as in a new case
of child molestation accusations
ahahahahah no worries
papa's got a brand new bag of toys
what else could i possibly do to make noise
i done touched on everything but little boys
and that's not a stab at michael
that's just a metaphor i'm just psycho
i go a little bit crazy sometimes
i get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
good god dip do a little slide
bend down touch your toes and just glide
up the center of the dance floor
like tp for my bunghole
and it's cool if you let one go
nobody's gonna know who'd hear it

and a pit bull in the seat these pigs'll get bit
foolin' with me quit foolin' with me
bitch you're gonna see no pistol in the seat
why it always gotta be an issue when you're me
and which you're gonna see in the long run i'ma be the wrong one
you wanna harass with this limotinted glass
flashin' that flashlight on my ass  where was you at
last night when them assholes ran up on my grass
rapper slash actor kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
they took away my right to bear arms
what i'm 'posed to fight with bare palms
yeah right they comin' with bombs
i'm comin' with flare guns we as americans
i make beaucoup bucks wearin' beaucoup vests
drama hangin' over my head like a voodoo hex
i coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
with youknowwho with an s tattooed to my chest
but i've finessed it now i've got the industry pissy
ever since me and dre split it fiftyfifty on 50
it's funny we got a buzz spreadin' quicker
than makin' paper airplanes out of a twenty
fuck money i don't rap for dead presidents
i'd rather see the president dead
it's never been said but i set precedents
and the standards and they can't stand it
my name shoulda been bastard the shit shoulda been plastered
on my forehead with a stamp i shoulda been blasted
i shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
but i'm too swift and fast for that i'm past it
i'm too old to go and cruise gratiot  fuck that shit
i done seen how fast this rap shit
can turn into some pappap shit that quick snap click
but this time they got the fuckin' automatic
ain't no one gon' test this man  clack click
shht i got a secret if you can keep it between us
i tuck two ninas under my jeans either side of my penis
under my long johns under my sean johns
one runin with the long arm of the law i'm long gone
i'ma do five years  no less than that no questions asked
so it might be a good idea that i stop right here
and quit while i'm ahead already in the red
already got a steady infrared meant for my head
a target on my back bigger problems than that
bin laden on my ass he probably gon' send a task
i ain't gon' even ask they ain't gon' let me pack
they ain't gon' give me my semi but i got my weed back
it's sick but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit
we say we do it for our baby but we don't
we do it for us it's lust 'cause neither one
of us trust each other so we fuck 'til we bust
and we cuss each other out we know what it's about shout
'til i throw you out the house you throw me out the house
i throw you on the couch punch you in the mouth
fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
then apologize after laughter pain
it's insane we're back in the same chapter again
and it's sad but it's true when i'm layin' here with you
there ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do 'cause
'cause i hate you do you hate me
good 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
it makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
on the bed and fuck you like i don't even know you
you fuck other people and i fuck other people
you're a slut but i'm equal i'm a mutt we're both evil
in our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
'cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it
we can make accusations people spread rumors
but they ain't got proof 'til they do it's just the two of us
it's you and me 'cause any chick can say that she screwin' me
but you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause true indeed
if you didn't i wouldn't be hittin'  yeah i would
'cause the sex is too damn good if i ran who would i run to
that would be this soft and warm
so it's off and on usually more off than on
but at least we know that we share this common bond
you're the only one i can fuck without a condom on
i hope the only reason that i cope is 'cause of that fact
and plus i can bust in that and that's why
i can never understand it that's why i don't try
from junior high until we both die it's silly
oh why must we try is it really so rough
that we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff
try to pull each other's legs until the other begs
we're lyin' to ourselves that's the beauty of it yeah
'cause we truly love each other that's why we always fightin'
all we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
and it's clear it ain't gonna change it's pentup rage
we both had we both feel like we've been upstaged
by someone else we've both been someone else's
someone else problem is neither one wants help
it's an addiction and it can't be fixed
our family's mixed up there's a baby sister in the mix
and it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
and anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
and they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time
on every song every lyric and every rhyme
all the hoopla all of the whooptywoo
what you put me through fuckin' whooptydo
but i won't be made a fool of if this is true love
you wouldn't do what you did last time you wouldn't screw up
this time 'cause this time girl i'm tellin' you what
you do it again i'm fuckin' you up
ever since i was introduced to rap music
i been missing a screw like bishop in juice i could lose it
at any moment those who know me know it
so they probably told to go with the flow just so that
i don't explode and have another episode
where i let it go as far as the one with benzino did
i'm waiting for that next beef i'm cocked locked and loaded
i'm ready to go so bad
i'm going bananas my dick's so hard anna
nicole could use it to fucking pole vault with
oh shit i mean when she was still bloated
before they cut her stomach open and lypo'd it heheheh
anybody i throw flames at gets a name
it's a game 'cause they know that they don't spit the same
it's a shame what people do for 10 minutes of fame
every day it's the same thing people in this game
try to buddybuddy us
just to get close enough to study us everybody just wants
to have something to do with that
they all trying to get that stamp they after that shadyaftermath money
it's like a monopoly
they probably just now finally understand how to rob fully
50 cent was like a fucking jackpot for me
and dre it's like we hit the fucking lottery
and the damn slot machine at the same time as each other
why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers
when we rhyme with each other in time we discovered
that we had more in common than we thought with each other
both robbed of our mothers our fathers ain't want us
what was wrong with us was it our fault
'cause we started thinking god doesn't love us
two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
what a coincidence 'cause when 50 got shot up in jamaica
queens i still remember the call up at chung king 'cause
big l had just got popped just a month before
if 50 lives he's getting dropped from columbia
two years later me and doc had to come and uhh
operate that's when he popped up at number one
and we ain't never gonna stop if you wondering
even if i'm under the gun
you ain't got to agree all the time with me or see eyetoeye
there'll always be animosity between you and i
but see the difference is if it is i could give a shit
i'm still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual
egos aside 'fore i bruise 'em all
swallow your pride 'fore i step on it with shoes you call
nikes earthlings how do you like these
you gotta love 'em look at the bottom of 'em they're like cleats
stomping i been romping
since tim dog was hollering fuck compton
i was whiling freestyling
back when they were still making maxell cassettes
i wasn't even rap's elvis yet that tells us that
any doubts in your head that seals the shit
ricky ticky toc ticky ticky toc
still with the diggy diggy doc diggy diggy doc
and ya' don't stop
you 'bout to witness hiphop in its most purest
most rawest form flow almost flawless
most hardest most honest known artist
chip off the old block but old doc is back
looks like batman brought his own robin
oh god saddam's got his own laden
with his own private plane his own pilot
set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges
oranges peach pears plums syringes
vrinn vrinn yeah here i come i'm inches
away from you dear fear none
hiphop is in a state of 911 so
quick gotta move fast gotta perform miracles
gee willikers dre holy bat syllables
look at all the bullshit that goes on in gotham
when i'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals
so skip to your lou while i do what i do best
you ain't even impressed no more you're used to it
flow's too wet nobody close to it
nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
the most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
in eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
they make it all up there's no such thing
like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
it just means so much more to so much more
people when you're rappin' and you know what for
the show must go on so i'd like to welcome y'all
to marshall and andre's carnival c'mon
it's just like old times the dynamic duo
two old friends why panic you already know
who's fully capable the two caped heroes
dial straight down the center eightzerozero
you can even call collect the most feared duet
since me and elton played career russian roulette
and never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat
people steppin' over people just to rush to the set
just to get to see an mc who breathes so freely
ease over these beats and be so breezy
jesus how can shit be so easy
how can one chandra be so levy
turn on these beats mcs don't see me
believe me bet and mtv
are gonna grieve when we leave dog fo' sheezy
can't leave rap alone the game needs me
'til we grow beards get weird and disappear
into the mountains nothin' but clowns down here
but we ain't fuckin' around 'round here
yo dre what up can i get a hell hell yeah
everybodys in a rush to try to get the throne
i just get on the track and try to set the tone
ain't trying to use nobody as a steppin' stone
but don't compare me i'm better off just left alone
and i ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
i'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
say what up keep steppin' and just rep d12
keep my nose clean stay away from weapons jail
and livin' wreckless but if you would check my belt
you may see something else i use to protect myself
a vest to stop a ruger and deflect the shells and
send em back at you faster than they left the barrel
and i don't even carry guns no more i don't got to
got under cover cops that'll legally pop you
and i done seen a lot of people crossed the line
but this motherfucker ja must've lost his mind
that x has got him thinkin' he was dmx
then he switched to pac now his tryin' to be him next
so which one are you x luther pac or michael
just keep singing the same song recycled
we'd all much rather get along than fight you
me and hailey dance to your songs we like you
and you don't really want to step inside no mic booth
come on now you know the white boy will bite you
i'll hurt your pride dog and you know i don't like to
but i will if i have to
with syllable after syllable ill just slap ya
killin' you faster
than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs of
that shit you on but if you want it you got it
you'd bump this shit too if we didn't diss you on it
but if we lock horns we can charge harder than busta
we bump heads with any motherfucker that wants ta
so what's the deal where was all of the tough talk
when i walked up to ya like ja what up dog
how come you didn't say you had a problem then
when you was standin' there with all you men
we could've solved it then i'm a grown man dogg come holla
all you did was slap hands smile and swallow
another one of them lil x pills in front of me
and tell me 50 cent was everything you want to be cmon
you couldn't slug me if my father helped you
my punchlines is hot my bars would melt you
ja you stuart little shells will lift you
every other week i'm buyin' a new pistol
i clap at yo ass with this chrome 38
and put 6 through your hats a 7 and 38's
irv you ain't suge knight you shook knight
i put my knife in ya wind pipe
then freeze on this turn pike
you know and i know who took ya chain
you got robbed two times so your ass is lame
i'm down to die for this shit all i need is bail
you better stick to the movies with steven segal
yo fuck that i'm tired of waiting
these industry niggas starting to get out of hand
like i won't find your whereabouts by stomping em out your man
we killin' new york even in compton they understand
i'm on the block where you was raised blowin' chocolate up out the van and
they see me pop up more icy because i could
you been gone so long you probably forgot your way around the hood good
least when your paranoid its hard to make a song
how you want it with us and half of your artists got makeup on
every magazine i open you on your knees takin' prayer pictures
and you ain't even get shot yet you scared bitches
you don't know nothin' bout what pain is sucker
i put your ass in the ground like a train conductor motherfucker
these ideas are nightmares to white parents
whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
like whatever they say has no bearing
it's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
to see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
alone in his own zone cold and he don't care he's
a problem child and what bothers him all comes out
when he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out bitch
'cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
his thoughts are wacked he's mad so he's talkin' back
talkin' black brainwashed from rock and rap
he sags his pants dorags and a stockin' cap
his stepfather hit him so he socked him back
and broke his nose his house is a broken home
there's no control he just lets his emotions go
entertainment is changin' intertwinin' with gangsters
in the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
holy or unholy only have one homie
only this gun lonely cause don't anyone know me
yet everybody just feels like they can relate huhuh
i guess words are a motherfucker they can be great
or they can degrade or even worse they can teach hate
it's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum
now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
from standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
to havin' a fortune no more kissin' ass
but then these critics crucify you yep journalists try to burn you
fans turn on you attorneys all want a turn at you
to get they hands on every dime you have
they want you to lose your mind every time you mad
so they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
that's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
but all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
so i'm signin' cds while police fingerprint me
they're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
if i'm such a fuckin' menace this shit doesn't make sense b
it's all political if my music is literal
and i'm a criminal how the fuck can i raise a little girl
i couldn't i wouldn't be fit to
you're full of shit too guerrera that was a fist that hit you bitch
they say music can alter moods and talk to you
well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too
well if it can then the next time you assault a dude
just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get sued
see what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
and they wanna get one cause they think the shit's cool
not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
we entertainers of course the shit's affectin' our sales
you ignoramus but music is reflection of self
we just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail
it's fucked up ain't it how we can come from practically nothin'
to bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
that's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine haha
who post pinup pictures on they walls all day long
idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
so they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die
'til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
we're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
that's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
squeeze it and hold it cause we consider these minutes golden
and maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our spirits
live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can
some days i just wanna up and call it quits
i feel like i'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
every time i go to get up i just fall in pits
my life's like one great big ball of shit
if i could just put it all into all i spit
'stead of always tryna swallow it
instead of starin' at this wall and shit
while i sit writer's block sick of all this shit
can't call it shit all i know is i'm about to hit the wall
if i have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits
this is it last straw that's all that's it
i ain't dealin' with another fuckin' politic
i'm like a skillet bubblin' until it filters up
i'm about to kill it i can feel it buildin' up
blow this building up i've concealed enough
my cup runneth over i done filled it up
the pen explodes and busts ink spills my guts
you think all i do is stand here and feel my nuts
well i'ma show you what you gon' feel my rush
you don't feel it then it must be too real to touch
peel the dutch i'm about to tear shit up
goosebumps yeah i'ma make your hair sit up
yeah sit up i'ma tell you who i be
i'ma make you hate me 'cause you ain't me
you wait it ain't too late to finally see
what you closedminded fucks were too blind to see
whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee
out this world ain't no one out their mind as me
you need peace of mind here's a piece of mine
all i need's a line
but sometimes i don't always find the words to rhyme
to express how i'm really feelin' at that time
yeah sometimes sometimes sometimes
it's just sometimes it's always me
how dark can these hallways be
the clock strikes midnight one two then halfpast three
this halfassed rhyme with this halfassed piece
of paper rip i'm desperate at my desk
if i can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again
stuck in a slump can't think of nothin'
fuck i'm stumped up oh wait here comes somethin'
crumples paper nope it's not good enough scribble it out
new pad crinkle it up and throw the shit out
i'm fizzlin' now thought i figured it out
ball's in my court but i'm scared to dribble it out
i'm afraid but why am i afraid
why am i a slave to this trade
cyanide i spit to the grave
real enough to rile you up
want me to flip it i can rip it any style you want
i'm a switch hitter bitch jimmy smith ain't a quitter
i'ma sit until i get enough in me to finally hit a
fuckin' boiling point put some oil in your joints
flip the coin bitch come get destroyed
an mc's worst dream i make 'em tense
they hate me see me and shake like a chainlink fence
by the looks of 'em you would swear that jaws was comin'
by the screams of 'em you would swear i'm sawin' someone
by the way they're runnin' you would swear the law was comin'
it's now or never and tonight is all or nothin'
momma jimmy keeps leavin' on us
he said he'd be back he pinky promised i don't think he's honest
i'll be back baby i just gotta beat this clock
fuck this clock i'ma make 'em eat this watch
don't believe me watch i'ma win this race
and i'ma come back and rub my shit in your face
bitch i found my niche you gon' hear my voice
'til you're sick of it you ain't gonna have a choice
if i gotta scream 'til i have half a lung
if i have half a chance i'll grab itrabbit run
his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
there's vomit on his sweater already mom's spaghetti
he's nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
to drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
he opens his mouth but the words won't come out
he's choking how everybody's joking now
the clock's run out time's up overblaow
snap back to reality ope there goes gravity ope
there goes rabbit he choked he's so mad but he won't
give up that easy no he won't have it he knows
his whole back's to these ropes it don't matter he's dope
he knows that but he's broke he's so stagnant he knows
when he goes back to this mobile home that's when it's
back to the lab again yo this old rap shit he
better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him and
his soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
this world is mine for the taking make me king
as we move toward a new world order
a normal life is boring but superstardom's
close to postmortem it only grows harder
homie grows hotter he blows it's all over
these hoes is all on him coasttocoast shows
he's known as the globetrotter lonely roads
god only knows he's grown farther from home he's no father
he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
but hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
these hoes don't want him no mo' he's cold product
they moved on to the next schmoe who flows
he nosedove and sold nada and so the soap opera
is told it unfolds i suppose it's old partner
but the beat goes on dadadom dadom dahdah dahdah
no more games i'ma change what you call rage
tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
i was playin' in the beginning the mood all changed
i've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
but i kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
all the pain inside amplified by the
fact that i can't get by with my nineto
five and i can't provide the right type of life for my family
'cause man these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
and there's no movie there's no mekhi phifer this is my life
and these times are so hard and it's gettin' even harder
tryna feed and water my seed plus teetertotter
caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
baby mama drama screamin' on her too much for me to wanna
stay in one spot another day of monotony's
gotten me to the point i'm like a snail i've got
to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
success is my only motherfuckin' optionfailure's not
mom i love you but this trailer's got
to go i cannot grow old in salem's lot
so here i go it's my shot feet fail me not
this may be the only opportunity that i got
have you ever been hated or discriminated against
i have i've been protested and demonstrated against
picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times
sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
all this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
not takin' nothin' from no one give 'em hell long as i'm breathin'
keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
see they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out
look at me now i bet you're prob'ly sick of me now
ain't you mama i'ma make you look so ridiculous now
i got some skeletons in my closet
and i don't know if no one knows it
so before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
i'ma expose it i'll take you back to '73
before i ever had a multiplatinumselling cd
i was a baby maybe i was just a couple of months
my faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
cause he split i wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
no i don't on second thought i just fuckin' wished he would die
i look at hailie and i couldn't picture leavin' her side
even if i hated kim i'd grit my teeth and i'd try
to make it work with her at least for hailie's sake
i maybe made some mistakes
but i'm only human but i'm man enough to face 'em today
what i did was stupid no doubt it was dumb
but the smartest shit i did was take the bullets out of that gun
cause i'da killed 'em shit i woulda shot kim and him both
it's my life i'd like to welcome y'all to the eminem show
now i would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
but put yourself in my position just try to envision
witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
goin' through public housing systems
victim of mnchausen's syndrome
my whole life i was made to believe i was sick when i wasn't
'til i grew up now i blew up
it makes you sick to your stomach doesn't it
wasn't it the reason you made that cd for me ma
so you could try to justify the way you treated me ma
but guess what you're gettin' older now
and it's cold when you're lonely
and nathan's growin' up so quick
he's gonna know that you're phony
and hailie's gettin' so big now you should see her she's beautiful
but you'll never see her she won't even be at your funeral haha
see what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
bitch do your song keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom
but how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
you selfish bitch i hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
remember when ronnie died and you said you wished it was me
well guess what i am dead dead to you as can be
my lyrical content is constantly under fire
no wonder why i constantly bomb back
to combat attacks with constant concepts
when lyrics are constantly took outta context
failure to communicate with congress has
been a problem for the longest i guess
but maybe one day we can make some progress
food for thought see how long it takes to digest
feelin' good when i should be ashamed
shit i really shoulda fell but i stood see i came
like a flame in the night
like a ghost in the dark
there's a ray there's a light
there's a hope there's a spark
but when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye
until they decide to set the differences aside
and this is why only one of us will survive
so children follow my lead and feel the vibe because
my music can be slightly amusin'
you shouldn't take lyrics so serious it might be confusin'
just tryin' to separate the truth from entertainment
it's stupid ain't it i get sick of tryin' to explain it
see i could sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
just being a snot pointynosed bleachblond
'cause i came here to uplift let your woes be gone
tell 'em to get fucked and just mosey on
constantly movin' constantly usin'
the constitution as a form of restitution
bless the children nothin' less than brilliant
let me entertain you like robbie williams
i'll be here when y'all are gone rebuildin'
world revolvin' still evolvin' still slim
how many kids will copy prob'ly millions
but i'ma do this as a fuckin' hobby till then 'cause
my lyrical content contains subject matter
that sucks up all these fucked up young kids
at an alarming rate common denominate
add it up and you'll see just why i dominate
i try to stimulate but kids emulate
and mimic every move you make slim you great
but wait can't you see i'm only here to entertain
i gotta be the one to go against the grain
'cause man i see it feel it live it but it's inhumane
for me to see you be influenced and pretend you ain't
but they don't understand that i've been through pain
if you get to know me i could be a friend you gain
but you can't just stand there and try to judge
it hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
and it's such a pleasure every button that i touch
i treasure every glutton that i punish in my lust but
i've created a monster 'cause nobody wants to
see marshall no more they want shady i'm chopped liver
well if you want shady this is what i'll give ya
a little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
than a shock when i get shocked at the hospital
by the doctor when i'm not cooperating
when i'm rocking the table while he's operating hey
you waited this long now stop debating
cause i'm back i'm on the rag and ovulating
i know that you got a job ms cheney
but your husband's heart problem's complicating
so the fcc won't let me be
or let me be me so let me see
they try to shut me down on mtv
but it feels so empty without me
so come on and dip bum on your lips
fuck that cum on your lips and some on your tits
and get ready cause this shit's about to get heavy
i just settled all my lawsuitsfuck you debbie
little hellions kids feeling rebellious
embarrassed their parents still listen to elvis
they start feeling like prisoners helpless
'til someone comes along on a mission and yells bitch
a visionary vision is scary
could start a revolution polluting the airwaves
a rebel so just let me revel and bask
in the fact that i got everyone kissing my ass smack
and it's a disaster such a catastrophe
for you to see so damn much of my assyou asked for me
well i'm back nananananananananana
fix your bent antenna tune it in and then i'm gonna
enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
the center of attention back for the winter
i'm interesting the best thing since wrestling
infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
testing attention please
feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
here's my ten cents my two cents is free
a nuisance who sent you sent for me
a tiskit a taskit i'll go tit for tat with
anybody who's talking this shit that shit
chris kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked
worse than them little limp bizkit bastards
and moby you can get stomped by obie
you 36yearold baldheaded fag blow me
you don't know me you're too old let go
it's over nobody listens to techno
now let's go just give me the signal
i'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
i've been dope suspenseful with a pencil
ever since prince turned himself into a symbol
but sometimes the shit just seems
everybody only wants to discuss me
so this must mean i'm disgusting
but it's just me i'm just obscene
though i'm not the first king of controversy
i am the worst thing since elvis presley
to do black music so selfishly
and use it to get myself wealthy hey
there's a concept that works
twenty million other white rappers emerge
but no matter how many fish in the sea
it'd be so empty without me
i sit back with this pack of zigzag's and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest mc on this on this earth
and since birth i've been cursed with this curse to just curse
and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension
dispensing these sentences getting this stress
that's been eating me recently off of this chest
and i rest again peacefully
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone when you freaks see me out
in the streets when i'm eating or feeding my daughter
to not come and speak to me i don't know you
and no i don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing
i'm not mr n'sync i'm not what your friends think
i'm not mr friendly i can be a prick if you tempt me
my tank is on empty no patience is in me
and if you offend me i'm lifting you ten feet in the air
i don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit
i'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
i'm tired of all you i don't mean to be mean
but that's all i can be it's just me
sometimes i just feel like my father
i hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense
it's constant and oh it's his lyrical content
the song 'guilty conscience' has gotten such rotten responses
and all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
so i point one back at 'em but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb it's the one you put up
when you don't give a fuck when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull 'cause they full of shit too
when a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on marilyn and the heroin
where were the parents at and look where it's at
middle america now it's a tragedy
now it's so sad to see an upperclass city havin' this happening
then attack eminem cause i rap this way
but i'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that i need
for the fire to burn and it's burning and i have returned
i'm so sick and tired of being admired
that i wish that i would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label let's stop with the fables
i'm not gonna be able to top on my name is
and pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
to cop me rotation at rocknroll stations
and i just do not got the patience
to deal with these cocky caucasians
who think i'm some wigger who just tries to be black
cause i talk with an accent and grab on my balls
so they always keep asking the same fucking questions
what school did i go to what hood i grew up in
the why the who what when the where and the how
'til i'm grabbing my hair and i'm tearin' it out
cause they driving me crazy i can't take it
i'm racin' i'm pacin' i stand and i sit
and i'm thankful for every fan that i get
but i can't take a shit
in the bathroom without someone standing by it
no i won't sign you an autograph
you can call me an asshole i'm glad
dear slim i wrote you but you still ain't callin'
i left my cell my pager and my home phone at the bottom
i sent two letters back in autumn you must not've got 'em
there probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
sometimes i scribble addresses too sloppy when i jot 'em
but anyways fuck it what's been up man how's your daughter
my girlfriend's pregnant too i'm 'bout to be a father
if i have a daughter guess what i'ma call her
i'ma name her bonnie
i read about your uncle ronnie too i'm sorry
i had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
i know you probably hear this every day but i'm your biggest fan
i even got the underground shit that you did with skam
i got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
i like the shit you did with rawkus too that shit was phat
anyways i hope you get this man hit me back
just to chat truly yours your biggest fan this is stan
dear slim you still ain't called or wrote i hope you have a chance
i ain't mad i just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
if you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert you didn't have to
but you coulda signed an autograph for matthew
that's my little brother man he's only six years old
we waited in the blisterin' cold
for you for four hours and you just said no
that's pretty shitty man you're like his fuckin' idol
he wants to be just like you man he likes you more than i do
i ain't that mad though i just don't like bein' lied to
remember when we met in denver
you said if i'd write you you would write back
see i'm just like you in a way i never knew my father neither
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
i can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
so when i have a shitty day i drift away and put 'em on
cause i don't really got shit else
so that shit helps when i'm depressed
i even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
sometimes i even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
it's like adrenaline the pain is such a sudden rush for me
see everything you say is real and i respect you cause you tell it
my girlfriend's jealous 'cause i talk about you 247
but she don't know you like i know you slim no one does
she don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
you gotta call me man i'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
sincerely yours stanps we should be together too
dear mr i'mtoogoodtocallorwritemyfans
this'll be the last package i ever send your ass
it's been six months and still no wordi don't deserve it
i know you got my last two letters i wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
so this is my cassette i'm sendin' you i hope you hear it
i'm in the car right now i'm doin' 90 on the freeway
hey slim i drank a fifth of vodka you dare me to drive
you know the song by phil collins in the air of the night
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
but didn't then phil saw it all then at a show he found him
that's kinda how this is you coulda rescued me from drownin'
now it's too late i'm on a thousand downers nowi'm drowsy
and all i wanted was a lousy letter or a call
i hope you know i ripped all of your pictures off the wall
i loved you slim we coulda been togetherthink about it
you ruined it now i hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
and when you dream i hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
i hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
see slimshut up bitch i'm tryin' to talk
hey slim that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
but i didn't slit her throat i just tied her upsee i ain't like you
cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
well gotta go i'm almost at the bridge now
oh shit i forgothow am i supposed to send this shit out
dear stan i meant to write you sooner but i just been busy
you said your girlfriend's pregnant now how far along is she
look i'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother i wrote it on a starter cap
i'm sorry i didn't see you at the show i must've missed you
don't think i did that shit intentionally just to diss you
but what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too
i say that shit just clownin' dawg come on how fucked up is you
you got some issues stan i think you need some counselin'
to help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
and what's this shit about us meant to be together
that type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
i really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
i hope you get to read this letter i just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself i think that you'll be doin' just fine
if you relax a little i'm glad i inspire you but stan
why are you so mad try to understand that i do want you as a fan
i just don't want you to do some crazy shit
i seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape but they didn't say who it was to
come to think about it his name wasit was you
my attitude is worse than nwa's was
i'll battle you over stupid shit
and diss people who ain't have shit to do with it
like cool j does my tattoo

screamin' puffy is good but slim shady is for the children

in your driveway and drive away what
are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with aids
blood drippin' from it
rippin' your stomach like a paper mch
you talk a lot of shit but you was never ill though
i'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
tipped over some cows just for a joke and a laugh
jumped up choked a giraffe
snapped his neck and broke it in half
wagin' wars went on stage
and sprayed cage with agent orange
and wiped my ass with his page in source here

just your nutsack by itself
and bang them shits with a spiked bat
cut your neck off then sew your head right back
and leave you like that
you just triggered a prick who just mixed liquor
who's itchin' to leave you disfigured
and stiffer than christopher reeves
i was dealing with strep throat
while your mother was breastfeeding
and gave her the flesheating disease
i'm iller than takin' a hammer and beating your knees
and walkin' through south central la bleeding in jeans
am i a blood or a crip
wakin' up the next day in breathing machines
flashin' back to bein' shot and repeating the scenes
on how you just got smoked and if you do live
you'll be too scared to tell it like a biggie and pac joke
i sit back with this pack of zigzag's and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest mc on this on this earth
and since birth i've been cursed with this curse to just curse
and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensin' these sentences

someone standin' by it standin' by it no i won't sign your autograph
you can call me an asshole i'm glad
hi there little boys and girls fuck you
today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels
but first i'd like you to meet my friend bob huh
say hi bob hi bob
bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
and he don't got a job 'cause bob sits at home and smokes pot
but his twelveyearold brother looks up to him an awful lot
and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
and wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks ahh
and even if they escaped and they got the cops
the ladies would all be so afraid they would drop the charge
'til one night mrs stacey went off the job
when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
but stacey knew it was bob and said knock it off
but bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
crazier than slim shady is off the vodka
you couldn't even take him to dre's to get bob a doctor
he grabbed stace' by the legs as he chopped it off her
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
but ever since the day stacey went off to wander
they never found her and bob still hangs at the waffle diner
and that's the story of bob and his marijuana
and what it might do to you
so see if the squirrels want itit's bad for you
my penis is the size of a peanut have you seen it
fuck no you ain't seen it it's the size of a peanut huh
speakin' of peanuts you know what else is bad for squirrels
ecstasyit's the worst drug in the world
if someone ever offers it to you don't do it
kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
and spinal fluid is final you won't get it back
so don't get attached or it'll attack every bone in your back
meet zach twentyone years old
after hangin' out with some friends at a frat party he gets bold
and decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys
and the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
suddenly he starts to convulse
and his pulse goes into hyperdrive
and his eyes roll back in his skull blblblblblb
his back starts to look like the mcdonald's arches
he's on donald's carpet layin' horizontal barfin' bleh
and everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
hey adam zach is a jackass look at him
'cause they took it too so they think it's funny
so they're laughing at basically nothing
except maybe wasting their money
meanwhile zach's in a coma the action is over
and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga
and that's the story of zach the ecstasy maniac
so don't even feed that to squirrels class 'cause it's bad for you
and last but not least one of the most humongous
problems among young people today is fungus
it grows from cow manure they pick it out wipe it off bag it up
and you put it right in your mouth and chew it
yumyum then you start to see some dumb stuff
and everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
and sometimes you see things that aren't there like what
like fat women in gstrings with orange hair
mr shady what's a gstring it's yarn claire
women stick 'em up their behinds go out and wear 'em huh
and if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
whoops did i say 'magic mushrooms' i meant fungus
your tongue gets all swoll up like a cow's tongue
how come 'cause it comes from a cow's dung gross
see drugs are bad it's a common fact
but your mom and dad know that's all that i'm good at oh
but don't be me 'cause if you grow up and you go and od
they're gonna come for me and i'ma have to grow a goatee
and get a disguise and hide 'cause it'll be my fault
so don't do drugs and do exactly as i don't 'cause i'm bad for you
c'mon haihai we goin' to the beach
grab a couple of toys and let dada strap you in the car seat
oh where's mama she's takin' a little nap in the trunk
oh that smell dada must've runned over a skunk
now i know what you're thinkin' it's kind of late to go swimmin'
but you know your mama she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things and if she don't get her way she'll throw a fit
don't play with dada's toy knife honey let go of it no
and don't look so upset why you actin' bashful
don't you wanna help dada build a sandcastle yeah
and mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
and don't worry about that little booboo on her throat
it's just a little scratch it don't hurt
her was eatin' dinner while you were sweepin'
and spilled ketchup on her shirt
mama's messy ain't she we'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can play by ourselves can't we
there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
a place called prison and a place called jail
and dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
'cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
and you don't want a brother do ya nah
maybe when you're old enough
to understand a little better i'll explain it to ya
but for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
was bein' mean to dad and made him real real mad
but i still feel sad that i put her on time out
sit back in your chair honey quit tryna climb out
i told you it's okay haihai want a baba
take a nightnight nanaboo googoogaga
her make poopoo caca dada change your didee
clean the baby up so her can take a nightynighty
your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 bonnie and clyde me and my daughter
wake up sweepyhead we're here before we pway
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
baby don't cry honey don't get the wrong idea
mama's too sweepy to hear you scweamin' in her ear mama
that's why you can't get her to wake but don't worry
dada made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
here you wanna help dada tie a rope around this rock yeah
we'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
ready now here we go on the count of free
one two free whee
there goes mama spashin' in the water
no more fightin' with dad no more restraining order
no more stepdada no more new brother
blow her kisses byebye tell mama you love her mommy
now we'll go play in the sand build a castle and junk
but first just help dad with two more things out the trunk
y'all act like you never seen a white person before
jaws all on the floor like pam like tommy just burst in the door
and started whoopin' her ass worse than before
they first were divorced suin' her over furniture agh
it's the return of the ah wait no way you're kidding
he didn't just say what i think he did did he
and dr dre said nothing you idiots
dr dre's dead he's locked in my basement ha ha
feminist women love eminem
chicka chicka chicka slim shady i'm sick of him
look at him walkin' around grabbin' his youknowwhat
flippin' the youknowwho yeah but he's so cute though
yeah i probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
but no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
sometimes i wanna get on tv and just let loose
but can't but it's cool for tom green to hump a dead moose
my bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips
and if i'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
and that's the message that we deliver to little kids
and expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
by the time they hit fourth grade
they've got the discovery channel don't they
we ain't nothin' but mammalswell some of us cannibals
who cut other people open like cantaloupes
but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
but if you feel like i feel i got the antidote
women wave your pantyhose sing the chorus and it goes
will smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records nope
well i do so fuck him and fuck you too
you think i give a damn about a grammy
half of you critics can't even stomach me let alone stand me
but slim what if you win wouldn't it be weird
why so you guys could just lie to get me here
so you can sit me here next to britney spears
shit christina aguilera better switch me chairs
so i can sit next to carson daly and fred durst
and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
little bitch put me on blast on mtv
yeah he's cute but i think he's married to kim heehee
i should download her audio on mp3
and show the whole world how you gave eminem vd agh
i'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
all you do is annoy me so i have been sent here to destroy you
and there's a million of us just like me
who cuss like me who just don't give a fuck like me
who dress like me walk talk and act like me
and just might be the next best thing but not quite me
i'm like a head trip to listen to cause i'm only givin' you
things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
the only difference is i got the balls to say it in front of y'all
and i don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
i just get on the mic and spit it
and whether you like to admit it i just shit it
better than 90 of you rappers out can
then you wonder how can
kids eat up these albums like valiums
it's funny cause at the rate i'm going when i'm 30
i'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
pinching nurse's asses when i'm jacking off with jergens
and i'm jerking but this whole bag of viagra isn't working
and every single person is a slim shady lurking
he could be working at burger king spittin' on your onion rings
or in the parking lot circling screaming i don't give a fuck
with his windows down and his system up
so will the real shady please stand up
and put one of those fingers on each hand up
and be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
and one more time loud as you can how does it go
hand me an eighth beam me up and land me in space
i'ma sit on top of the world and shit on brandy and mase
i'm more than ill scarier than a white journalist
in a room with lauryn hill human horror film
but with a lot funnier plot and people'll feel me
'cause i'ma still be the mad rapper whether i got money or not
as long as i'm on pills and i got plenty of pot
i'll be in a canoe paddling making fun of your yacht
but i would like an award for the best rapper to get
one mic in the source and a wardrobe i can afford
otherwise i might just end up back strikin' at ford
and you wonder what the fuck i need more vicodin for
everybody's pissin' me off even the no limit tank
looks like a middle finger sideways flippin' me off
no shit i'm a grave danger to my health
why else would i kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself
i'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless patrollin' corners
lookin' for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
i'm meaner in action than roscoe beatin' james todd senior
across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments
i grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth
with a fucked up childhood that i used as an excuse
and ain't shit changed i kept the same mindstate
since the third time that i failed ninth grade
you probably think that i'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
i don't promote violence i just encourage it
i laugh at the sight of death as i fall down a cement flight of steps
and land inside a bed of spider webs
so throw caution to the wind you and a friend
can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again
shit why not blow your brain out i'm blowin' mine out
fuck it you only live once you might as well die now
my laser disc'll make you take a razor to your wrist
make you satanistic make you take the pistol to your face
and place the clip and cock it back
and let it go until your brains are rippin' out your skull
so bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
i'm not a role model i don't wanna babysit kids
i got one little girl and hailie jade is shady's business
and shady's just an alias i made to make you pissed off
where the fuck were you when gilbert's paid to make me dishwash
i make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
you made me get a bigger attitude than eighty kim scotts
and she almost got the same fate that grady's bitch got
i knew that just the two of us would make you hate me this much
and just the two of us that ain't got shit to do with us
and our personal life it's just words on a mic
so you can call me a punk a pervert or a chauvinist pig
but the funny shit is that i still go with the bitch
hi kids do you like violence yeah yeah yeah
wanna see me stick nineinch nails through each one of my eyelids uhhuh
wanna copy me and do exactly like i did yeah yeah
try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is huh
my brain's dead weight i'm tryna get my head straight
but i can't figure out which spice girl i want to impregnate oh
and dr dre said slim shady you a basehead uhuh
then why's your face red man you wasted
well since age 12 i felt like i'm someone else
'cause i hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
got pissed off and ripped pamela lee's tits off
and smacked her so hard i knocked her clothes backwards like kris kross
i smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
come here slut shady wait a minute that's my girl dawg
i don't give a fuck god sent me to piss the world off
my english teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high shh
thanks a lot next semester i'll be 35
i smacked him in his face with an eraser chased him with a stapler
and stapled his nuts to a stack of paper ow
walked in the strip club had my jacket zipped up
flashed the bartender then stuck my dick in the tip cup
extraterrestrial running over pedestrians in a spaceship while they're screaming at me let's just be friends
99 percent of my life i was lied to
i just found out my mom does more dope than i do damn
i told her i'd grow up to be a famous rapper
make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
oh thank you
you know you blew up when the women rush your stands
and try to touch your hands like some screamin' usher fans
ahh ahh ahh
this guy at white castle asked for my autograph dude can i get your autograph
so i signed it dear dave thanks for the support asshole
stop the tape this kid needs to be locked away get him
dr dre don't just stand there operate
i'm not ready to leave it's too scary to die fuck that
i'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
huh yup
am i comin' or goin' i can barely decide
i just drank a fifth of vodka dare me to drive go ahead
all my life i was very deprived
i ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide whoops
clothes ripped like the incredible hulk
i spit when i talk i'll fuck anything that walks come here
when i was little i used to get so hungry i would throw fits
how you gonna breastfeed me mom you ain't got no tits
i lay awake and strap myself in the bed
with a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head bang
'cause i'm steamin' mad grr
and by the way when you see my dad yeah
tell him that i slit his throat in this dream i had
doesn't take much for me to raise such a stink up
when motherfuckers hate your guts
you ain't even gotta say much
for me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper
is like smearing a bloodstain with a paint brush
i cant explain what it is my brain does
but however it works it's insane it's plain nuts
and it ain't just my brain thats dangerous
its a whole combination of things it takes nuts
and im not afraid to raise the stakes up
i got a million bucks in the bank and eight trucks
for anybody who gets on the track and spanks us
i'm patiently waiting for the day im anxious
to see the look on ya fake mugs when you thugs go bankrupt
ya drunk you ain't tough
whatever you drank must've just turned you into some gangstas
this is me talking motherfucker this aint drugs
you wanna pop shit wake up then make up
fuck that its too late chump now face up
i pray for the day that someone who spits with the caliber that nas and jay does
opens up his jaw to say somethin' or rattle my name off
or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
so i can blow the fucking dust off of this chainsaw
and give him the surgery that he came for
'til i pull the paint off i never been shot
but i think me and fifty must've been cut from the same cloth
'cause i've always came off like ja's chain when they try to rush him
and lost and came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
i dont stop only thing that i wait for
is the day that i ain't gotta report to probate court
'cause i'ma give you all a reason to hate more
'cause i been holding my tongue 'til i got a sprained jaw
a lot of rappers on my list that just aint ja
and i'ma read that motherfucker off come april
you pussies think i went soft 'cause 8 mile
when i come back ill be shooting more than just paintballs
trust me
a couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
there's a couple of cops hot on my trail but this time
when i get pulled over there's a doberman pinscher
and a pit bull in the seat these pigs'll get bit
foolin' with me quit foolin' with me
bitch you're gonna see no pistol in the seat
why it always gotta be an issue when you're me
and which you're gonna see in the long run i'ma be the wrong one
you wanna harass with this limotinted glass
flashin' that flashlight on my ass  where was you at
last night when them assholes ran up on my grass
rapper slash actor kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
they took away my right to bear arms
what i'm 'posed to fight with bare palms
yeah right they comin' with bombs
i'm comin' with flare guns we as americans
i make beaucoup bucks wearin' beaucoup vests
drama hangin' over my head like a voodoo hex
i coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
with youknowwho with an s tattooed to my chest
but i've finessed it now i've got the industry pissy
ever since me and dre split it fiftyfifty on 50
it's funny we got a buzz spreadin' quicker
than makin' paper airplanes out of a twenty
fuck money i don't rap for dead presidents
i'd rather see the president dead
it's never been said but i set precedents
and the standards and they can't stand it
my name shoulda been bastard the shit shoulda been plastered
on my forehead with a stamp i shoulda been blasted
i shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
but i'm too swift and fast for that i'm past it
i'm too old to go and cruise gratiot  fuck that shit
i done seen how fast this rap shit
can turn into some pappap shit that quick snap click
but this time they got the fuckin' automatic
ain't no one gon' test this man  clack click
shht i got a secret if you can keep it between us
i tuck two ninas under my jeans either side of my penis
under my long johns under my sean johns
one runin with the long arm of the law i'm long gone
i'ma do five years  no less than that no questions asked
so it might be a good idea that i stop right here
and quit while i'm ahead already in the red
already got a steady infrared meant for my head
a target on my back bigger problems than that
bin laden on my ass he probably gon' send a task
i ain't gon' even ask they ain't gon' let me pack
they ain't gon' give me my semi but i got my weed back
it's sick but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit
we say we do it for our baby but we don't
we do it for us it's lust 'cause neither one
of us trust each other so we fuck 'til we bust
and we cuss each other out we know what it's about shout
'til i throw you out the house you throw me out the house
i throw you on the couch punch you in the mouth
fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
then apologize after laughter pain
it's insane we're back in the same chapter again
and it's sad but it's true when i'm layin' here with you
there ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do 'cause
'cause i hate you do you hate me
good 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
it makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
on the bed and fuck you like i don't even know you
you fuck other people and i fuck other people
you're a slut but i'm equal i'm a mutt we're both evil
in our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
'cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it
we can make accusations people spread rumors
but they ain't got proof 'til they do it's just the two of us
it's you and me 'cause any chick can say that she screwin' me
but you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause true indeed
if you didn't i wouldn't be hittin'  yeah i would
'cause the sex is too damn good if i ran who would i run to
that would be this soft and warm
so it's off and on usually more off than on
but at least we know that we share this common bond
you're the only one i can fuck without a condom on
i hope the only reason that i cope is 'cause of that fact
and plus i can bust in that and that's why
i can never understand it that's why i don't try
from junior high until we both die it's silly
oh why must we try is it really so rough
that we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff
try to pull each other's legs until the other begs
we're lyin' to ourselves that's the beauty of it yeah
'cause we truly love each other that's why we always fightin'
all we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
and it's clear it ain't gonna change it's pentup rage
we both had we both feel like we've been upstaged
by someone else we've both been someone else's
someone else problem is neither one wants help
it's an addiction and it can't be fixed
our family's mixed up there's a baby sister in the mix
and it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
and anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
and they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time
on every song every lyric and every rhyme
all the hoopla all of the whooptywoo
what you put me through fuckin' whooptydo
but i won't be made a fool of if this is true love
you wouldn't do what you did last time you wouldn't screw up
this time 'cause this time girl i'm tellin' you what
you do it again i'm fuckin' you up
now once upon a time not long ago
there was a little rapper about to blow
but his album came and it was not good
i think it went lead or double copperwood
so these silly little fans they were misled
by a nerdy internet computer hiphop head
me and you clef we're gonna make some cash
grab this silver paint and just paint my ass
hey mister would you care to bear witness to
the asswhippin' i'm about to administer
to this asskissin' little vaginal blister
stanibus little marshall mathers' sister
and in this corner we have the mr
nothavin'it it's the mad sinister
dr evil with his bag of tricks for
this little antagonistic faggot
dicksucking exll cool j fan from windsor
i'm 'bout to murder little kennyfagkaniffsta
you bastard i ain't wanna have to diss ya
canibus where the fuck you at i miss ya
now at first i ain't really understand this shit
picture me for a second and imagine it
chillin' in the bat mansion relaxin' when
all of a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners it's
canibitch on some 'stan lives' shit
it creeped me out at first man this is sick
but me bein' just as sick this conflict
gets my dick harder than arithmetic
and i know how you jealous ones envy
i shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
the first two letters you were tellin' me shit like
you respect me like any other regular mc
the third letter you asked how come i ain't return
none of the messages at shady records you left me
the fourth letter slim you're really startin' to upset me
the fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me
the sixth letter there's a bomb threat on our building
this crazy motherfucker's really tryna kill me
so i went back and read the first few letters that said
some shit about a message you left
oh shit that's not a e that's an a
this dude wants to leave me a 'massage' he's gay
right away i'm on the phone with dr dre
we got a bogey marshall i'm on the way
so in two seconds flat dre's at my crib
only thing is we both know where this kid lives
and neither one of us have canadian citizenship
shit oh dre wait a minute that's it
all we gotta do is use a bit of turboboost
we can fly over the border let's go whoosh
so we're off to toronto and we're gainin' speed
what was that oh jermaine dupri
fuck it keep goin' no time to waste
wait back up hit him one more time in case
okay fuck now he's draggin' under the car
oh well only thirty more thousand miles
meanwhile me and dre are tryna conversate
just tryna find a reason for the constant hate
and tryna figure out what happened to 'germaine propane'
he couldn't have fell off that hard ain't no way
what happened to the way you was rappin'
when you was scandalous
that canibus turned into a television evangelist
plus he raps with his regular voice
yo yo yo yo
have you ever been hated or discriminated against
i've been protested and demonstrated against
picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times
sick as the mind of the motherfin' kid that's behind
all this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
not takin' nothin' from no one give 'em hell long as i'm breathin'
keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
see they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out
look at me now i bet you're probably sick of me now
ain't you mama i'ma make you look so ridiculous now
look so ridiculous now look so ridiculous now
look so ridiculous now make you look so ridiculous now
now now now now now now
remembering me discover and see
all over the world she's known as a girl
to those who are free their minds shall be keep
forgotten as the past 'cause history will last
his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
there's vomit on his sweater already mom's spaghetti
he's nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
to drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
he opens his mouth but the words won't come out
he's choking how everybody's joking now
the clock's run out time's up overblaow
snap back to reality there goes gravity
there goes rabbit he choked he's so mad but he won't
give up that easy no he won't have it he knows
his whole back's to these ropes it don't matter he's dope
he knows that but he's broke he's so stagnant he knows
when he goes back to this mobile home that's when it's
back to the lab again yo
i got some skeletons in my closet
and i don't know if no one knows it
so before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
i'ma expose it i'll take you back to '73
before i ever had a multiplatinumselling cd
i was a baby maybe i was just a couple of months
my faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
cause he split i wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
no i don't on second thought i just fuckin' wished he would die
i look at hailie and i couldn't picture leavin' her side
even if i hated kim i'd grit my teeth and i'd try
to make it work with her at least for hailie's sake
i maybe made some mistakes
but i'm only human but i'm man enough to face 'em today
what i did was stupid no doubt it was dumb
but the smartest shit i did was take the bullets out of that gun
cause i'da killed him shit i woulda shot kim and him both
it's my life i'd like to welcome y'all to the eminem show
no more games i'ma change what you call rage
tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
i was playin' in the beginning the mood all changed
i've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
but i kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
all the pain inside amplified by the
fact that i can't get by with my nineto
five and i can't provide the right type of life for my family
'cause man these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
and there's no movie there's no mekhi phifer this is my life
and these times are so hard and it's gettin' even harder
tryna feed and water my seed plus teetertotter
caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
baby mama drama screamin' on her too much for me to wanna
stay in one spot another day of monotony's
gotten me to the point i'm like a snail i've got
to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
success is my only motherfuckin' optionfailure's not
mom i love you but this trailer's got
to go i cannot grow old in salem's lot
so here i go it's my shot feet fail me not
this may be the only opportunity that i got
i'm withholdin' my anger though i'd like to be the strangler
of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
it's my right to insist that he acknowledge my existence
but he just displays complete lack of respect
that's what he says to himself as he uses his magazines to trash me
as he sits with both his feet up at his desk
smokes a bag of his weed and starts imaginin' things
and he just can't see that he's manically depressed
and in his jealousy and envy it just whirls him in a frenzy
as he turns on mtv and sees my face
he don't exist in this world so he just twists and he twirls
spirals and spins 'til he hurls himself into a rage
and it's destroyin' him slowly 'cause he does not even know me
even though he sees me everywhere he goes
so he just tortures himself he has no fortune and wealth
so he extorts someone else to get his dough
and now he's actin' like a bully so he tries to push and pull me
but he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
and he has no choice but to scream and raise his voice up at me
'cause it annoys him to see that i ain't scared
now i'm not tryin' to make no more enemies no more unfortunately
there's so many other motherfuckers there just are
they just keep houndin' at me now that i'm down with 50
suddenly now i got beef with this faggot ja hahahaha
but his ass is such a puppet irv could shove his whole hand up it
and just make him say what he wants him to say
but suge has irv on a string and irv's so nervous that he
says anything to this man to keep him at bay
so now ja thinks that he's so tough and murder inc's the big bad wolf
and they go huff and puff and blow our label down
but our building's made out of bricks so you ain't takin' out shit
and dawg you just did a song with bobby brown
so now you try to pull the race card and it backfires in your face hard
'cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
plus this stylist you fucked when you was ecstasied up
was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch
now what bothers me the most about hiphop is we're so close
to pickin' up where we left off with big and pac
we just lost jam master j big l got blasted away
plus we lost bugz slang ton and freaky tah
it's like a neverending cycle that just seems to come full circle
everybody's gotta be so fuckin' hard
and i'm not excludin' myself 'cause i been stupid as well
i been known to lose it when someone says something smart
but as we grow as men we learn to let shit go but then again
there's only so much bullshit we can really stand
we all got reps to uphold when someone steps on our toes
it's no exception it goes for every man
but if irv really gave a fuck about ja like he claims he does
he'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
but he just keeps feedin' him pills so if that e doesn't kill him
someone from gunit will and i ain't buzzed
dawg i'm talkin' to you straight if the situation escalates
any worse we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
and if i get killed for this rap i got a million in cash
that says i will get you back in hailie's name
i'm about to get rid of some hoes it's simple
i'm quick to murder ink with lead
and i ain't talking 'bout a pencil
look at what the fuck you done got into
i see you found your niche you just a bitch with a menstrual
claiming you a murderer and you spelled it wrong
you put e before the d cause that's all you on
you on pac's dick you a replica guy
if he was still alive you would never get by
all you do is cry bitch keep it real
life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
and what kind of motherfucker ruins three deals
that another nigga got you they didn't see skills
and i ain't playin' you a brother getting cheated
and ja rule be prayin' on his cover cause he need it
and all you niggas hating shut your mouths
it's just that real niggas ain't buying that shit y'all put out
doe rae me but we don't sing motherfuckers
so murder inc do your thing motherfuckers
you unleashed on a team
who expects nothin' less than rb coming from that regime
regime is a little extreme
neck and neck with soldiers motherfuckin' marines
ja sold his soul to sing
weave eyewitness team on the tv screen chase the greed
now that you've embraced the green
don't fuck with the triple beams
you's a motherfuckin' actor slash pac impersonating rapper
slash billie holiday  how it happen
artist and repertoire saw him in action
pac assassination def jam grabbed him
told him reenact him you go platinum
they seen it for sure i know that afeni shakur
don't enjoy jeffrey atkins reenacting her boy
so i'm clickclackin' this toy mash and destroy
shady slash aftermath and detroit motherfucker
now we can get past the mean mugs and get to the slugs
to the grievance and the crying and the intimate hugs
we don't take you serious nigga you shook
you half of a halfway crook get off x dick go sing a hook
nigga and you can't replace the late great one
and when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one
nigga please stick to the script
before the guns stick to the clip
and benzino you ain't shit but a bitch
fuckin' oldass ignorant innocentlookin' senior citizen
built up slap you like grimace all sensitive
wait a minute hold on is it me or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on
a bitchmade man now how you gonna connect
with them short ass arms like a tyrannosaurus rex
you niggas can scream holler and curse
go ahead and respond
and pull that pen and pad up outta your purse
slim didn't send proof to get at the wankstas
he told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
what up gotti and this little war you pushed on
put your ear to the ground for stepping on bush stones
what's wrong didn't think we strong with real niggas
roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
it's real business y'all ain't caught the concept
you talking nonsense to walking bomb threats
contact was blown by benzetta in the source
threaten at the boss you gon' see me on your porch
now irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
but detroit niggas early and ain't scurred to bust
word to my nigga bugz punks like you get beat up
stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater
this rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
with dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
who's behind ya cadillac pac or that transvestite
that dress like a lil kim fox
you're just like a little windbox
press tight on the trigger of this glock
swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat
you knock pac's songs without love to help you sleep
you got shot in your video trying mock pac
you mockaveli get your own identity
my lyrical content is constantly under fire
no wonder why i constantly bomb back
to combat attacks with constant concepts
when lyrics are constantly took outta context
failure to communicate with congress has
been a problem for the longest i guess
but maybe one day we can make some progress
food for thought see how long it takes to digest
feelin' good when i should be ashamed
shit i really shoulda fell but i stood see i came
like a flame in the night
like a ghost in the dark
there's a ray there's a light
there's a hope there's a spark
but when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye
until they decide to set the differences aside
and this is why only one of us will survive
so children follow my lead and feel the vibe because
my music can be slightly amusin'
you shouldn't take lyrics so serious it might be confusin'
just tryin' to separate the truth from entertainment
it's stupid ain't it i get sick of tryin' to explain it
see i could sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
just being a snot pointynosed bleachblond
'cause i came here to uplift let your woes be gone
tell 'em to get fucked and just mosey on
constantly movin' constantly usin'
the constitution as a form of restitution
bless the children nothin' less than brilliant
let me entertain you like robbie williams
i'll be here when y'all are gone rebuildin'
world revolvin' still evolvin' still slim
how many kids will copy prob'ly millions
but i'ma do this as a fuckin' hobby till then 'cause
my lyrical content contains subject matter
that sucks up all these fucked up young kids
at an alarming rate common denominate
add it up and you'll see just why i dominate
i try to stimulate but kids emulate
and mimic every move you make slim you great
but wait can't you see i'm only here to entertain
i gotta be the one to go against the grain
'cause man i see it feel it live it but it's inhumane
for me to see you be influenced and pretend you ain't
but they don't understand that i've been through pain
if you get to know me i could be a friend you gain
but you can't just stand there and try to judge
it hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
and it's such a pleasure every button that i touch
i treasure every glutton that i punish in my lust but
some days i just wanna up and call it quits
i feel like i'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
every time i go to get up i just fall in pits
my life's like one great big ball of shit
if i could just put it all into all i spit
'stead of always tryna swallow it
instead of starin' at this wall and shit
while i sit writer's block sick of all this shit
can't call it shit all i know is i'm about to hit the wall
if i have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits
this is it last straw that's all that's it
i ain't dealin' with another fuckin' politic
i'm like a skillet bubblin' until it filters up
i'm about to kill it i can feel it buildin' up
blow this building up i've concealed enough
my cup runneth over i done filled it up
the pen explodes and busts ink spills my guts
you think all i do is stand here and feel my nuts
well i'ma show you what you gon' feel my rush
you don't feel it then it must be too real to touch
peel the dutch i'm about to tear shit up
goosebumps yeah i'ma make your hair sit up
yeah sit up i'ma tell you who i be
i'ma make you hate me 'cause you ain't me
you wait it ain't too late to finally see
what you closedminded fucks were too blind to see
whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee
out this world ain't no one out their mind as me
you need peace of mind here's a piece of mine
all i need's a line
but sometimes i don't always find the words to rhyme
to express how i'm really feelin' at that time
yeah sometimes sometimes sometimes
it's just sometimes it's always me
how dark can these hallways be
the clock strikes midnight one two then halfpast three
this halfassed rhyme with this halfassed piece
of paper rip i'm desperate at my desk
if i can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again
stuck in a slump can't think of nothin'
fuck i'm stumped up oh wait here comes somethin'
crumples paper nope it's not good enough scribble it out
new pad crinkle it up and throw the shit out
i'm fizzlin' now thought i figured it out
ball's in my court but i'm scared to dribble it out
i'm afraid but why am i afraid
why am i a slave to this trade
cyanide i spit to the grave
real enough to rile you up
want me to flip it i can rip it any style you want
i'm a switch hitter bitch jimmy smith ain't a quitter
i'ma sit until i get enough in me to finally hit a
fuckin' boiling point put some oil in your joints
flip the coin bitch come get destroyed
an mc's worst dream i make 'em tense
they hate me see me and shake like a chainlink fence
by the looks of 'em you would swear that jaws was comin'
by the screams of 'em you would swear i'm sawin' someone
by the way they're runnin' you would swear the law was comin'
it's now or never and tonight is all or nothin'
momma jimmy keeps leavin' on us
he said he'd be back he pinky promised i don't think he's honest
i'll be back baby i just gotta beat this clock
fuck this clock i'ma make 'em eat this watch
don't believe me watch i'ma win this race
and i'ma come back and rub my shit in your face
bitch i found my niche you gon' hear my voice
'til you're sick of it you ain't gonna have a choice
if i gotta scream 'til i have half a lung

speak up you're mumbling what the fucka you's a
bibibay okay bigbibibaby this is shady

to hold it together it's turning back into a newspaper
and ya'll got somethin' for my ass every issue
thank you 'cause i keep runnin' out of fucking tissues
and i could diss you but god i was sick of looking at you
at least now i can see when nike's got a new tennis shoe
butbut i guess no good news is always goodgood news
moving on to bigger and better things chicka chicka jeera
50's blowing up this year just keeps going up
what the fuck is going on who the fuck is norah jones
shady wait a minute baby leave the whore alone
just go up there and be humble and take them awards home
bush has just declared the world a fucking war zone
meanwhile we got a war going on of our own at home
my fuckin' mind's blown
trying to figure out how to fight my own clone
rhinestones are so nice they shine so bright
especially at night
after a hit of ecstasy ain't that right ro'oh
wait a minute i'm rambling
back to the matter at hand it's green lantern
with elvis presley the selfish mc
back to ruin rap and destroy the industry
single handedly and oh man did we
yeah me and 50 obie me and twizzy
and nelly and missy and jigga
god damn it's all a plan devised by the man it's a conspiracy
against fake shit and anybody who can't make hits or ain't dope lyrically
so fuck what you heard and what you read about
we ain't ruining rap baby we're just trying to weed it out
shady in the place to be see
and i got what it takes to rock the mic aight
still keep talking shit to me punk
'cause your magazine's over in less than six months
everybody's in a rush to try to get the throne
i just get on the track and try to set the tone
i ain't tryin' to use nobody as a steppin' stone
but don't compare me i'm better off just left alone
and i ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
i'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
say what up keep steppin' and just rep d12
keep my nose clean stay away from weapons jail
and livin' reckless but if you go check my belt
you may see something else i use to protect myself
a vest to stop a rueger and deflect the shells
and send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
and i don't even carry guns no more i don't got to
got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
and i done seen a lot of people cross the line
but this motherfucker ja must have lost his mind
that x got him thinkin' he was dmx
then he switched to pac now he's tryna be him next
so which one are you x luther pac or michael
just keep singin' the same song recycled
we'd all much rather get along than fight you
me and hailie dance to your songs we like you
and you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
come on now you know the white boy'll bite you
i'll hurt your pride dawg and you know i don't like to
but i will if i have to with syllable after
syllable i just slap you killin' you faster
than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs
of that shit you on but if you want it you got it
you'd bump this shit too if we ain't diss you on it
but if we lock horns we can charge harder than busta green lantern
we bump heads with any motherfucker that wants to
so what's the deal where was all the tough talk
when i walked up to you like ja what up dawg
how come you didn't say you had a problem then
when you was standin' there with all your men we coulda solved this then
i'm a grown man dawg come holla
all you did was slap hands smile and swallow
another one of them little x pills in front of me
and tell me 50 cent was everything you wanna be
come on
you couldn't son me if my father helped you
my punchlines is hot my bars will melt you
ja you stuart little shells'll lift you
every other week i'm buyin' a new pistol
i clap at your ass with this chrome 38
and put six thru your hats a seven and 38's
irv you ain't suge knight you shook night
i'll put my knife in your wind pipe and breeze through the turnpike
you know and i know who took your chain
you got robbed two times so your ass is lame
i'm down to die for this shit all i need is bail
you better stick to the movies with steven segal bitch
fuck that i'm miles away
and these industry niggas startin' to get outta hand
like i won't find your whereabouts by stompin' 'em out your man
we killin' new york even in compton they understand
i'm on the block where you was raised blowin' chocolate up out your van and break it break it break it down
they see me pop a boy icy 'cause i could
you been gone so long you probably forgot your way around the hood hood
'cause when you paranoid it's hard to make a song
how you want it with us if half of your artists got makeup on
every magazine i open you on your knees takin' prayer pictures
and you ain't even got shot yet you scared bitches
you don't know nothin' 'bout what pain is sucka
i'll put your ass underground like a train conductor muh'fucker
yo
everywhere we go people know we roll deep as fuck
forty fifty samoans they knowin' when dbo was
50 tweezy obie there won't be no ho in us
they pop shit like they gonna do shit but no one does
from new york down to texas back up to los angeles
we changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
you may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us ha
it's funny i guess money does have its advantages
and it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched
it's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much it's just
that if someone ever does put us in the clutch
we just know that y'all ain't gon' be the one who's gon' do it
'cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that
you fuck around get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
that you got no business being in we ain't even gon' be in it
no one's gonna hear nothing no one's gonna see this shit
and they'll be in and up out of it them boys is 'bout it 'bout it
the noise from clips and rounds be drowned out by the crowd
and you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing
'til the club closes and clears out and that's when they see you flattened
nobody saw it happen all 'cause your jaws are flapping
and you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping
it ain't about the music no more it's 'bout trying to show off
and it feels like any minute the bomb is about to go off
took my strap off my holster 'cause shit is getting serious
all theses drugs you be fucking with make you delirious
thinking you coming with heat yo son i'm curious
how long are you gonna hate us and judge us and jury us
some people can never fade us that make us so furious
mistake us for fakers homie we greater and glorious
we living for real and others just making the stories up
illusions are broken so live it up you corny fucks
if you take a fucking minute to think about what you done
when you stood against the gangster who live and die by the gun
caught a hot one sprayin' you bitches 'til there was none
i'm like a rolling stone homie i got you under my thumb
you silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches
we cut you and give you stitches for envyin' all our riches
the game's just like a midget you clockin' a small digit
dealing with the giant goliath people that's how we live it c'mon
uh ganxsta ganxsta who come to pay you a visit
on the shit you call hiphop this function is where did it
when i put it in motion my focus is getting branded
my appetite for destruction is blasted because i said it
got you stumbling for cover this music dying in numbers
but you wouldn't pause and wonder admitting it's all glamour
when you enter the business you thinking you running shit
you witness that funny shit your bitches they ain't shit
we gangstas we blast first ask questions later
all these imitators parading like they some players
tryna save hiphop the task is something greater
'cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivators
get caught i'm not telling or more like killing not caring
i'm riding a gangsta feeling no fearing when gangstas dying
i'm in a full circle with homies that's s'posed to bleed
on an 8 mile mission with cypress and og's
for whatever it's worth it's worth me havin' my ass whipped
'cause i'ma have the last lips to ever kiss ass with
i just can't get past these little piss ants
that wanna be brawny bad asses so bad
and they so mad they can't stand it
'cause we can and they can't spit
and they can't handle it like a man
and that's when it just happens
and i snap and it's a wrap and it's scrap and then it isn't rap is it
hiphop isn't a sport anymore when you gotta go and resort back into that shit
maybe i'm oldfashioned but my passion is to smash anyone rappin' without havin' to slap him
believe me i'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol but i'm pissed now
but it all depends on just how far it gets took on the mic
'cause i'm tellin' you right now you're not gonna like it
'cause if i get pushed over the edge then i'm pullin' you with me
you poke a stick at a pit bull you get bit b
these words stick to you like krazy glue when you diss me
'cause they just bounce off me like bullets to 50
i'm the beautifullest thing and you gonna miss me when i'm gone
like keith murray when he threw a stool and hit a girl accidentally
i do this for swifty kon and kuniva bizzy  proof are you with me
they consider me the epitome me of a beef starter
in a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one
fuck slugs i'm walkin' gloves with a shotgun
constantly poppin' slugs they hot son better not run
the bosses of all bosses a holocaust to whoever ain't conscious
in a house full of dog shit
i'm a gothic death project you stop breathin'
you die quicker than mach speed without bleedin'
it ain't about what you readin'
when you meet me better speak like a season's greetings
either that or we'll be beefin' frequent
you niggas need an ''e'' just to speak shit
your leader's a petite bitch
keep the heater where you can reach quick
i snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret
nigga i did it from the mind of a mental patient
when glocks wave you can save that conversation for satan
you brave
i heard you niggas don't like us but so what
this beef is like what the fuck did he say in his rap em
i can see that he's just a punk
i mean these niggas squeeze on me
please i'm seeing guts
i don't need no enemies as my family a couple trucks and my mpc and a mic
they empty out on them bike to fight you
in front of every reporter that i don't like
no need for metaphors to get points across when i write
this emotion's enough to say fuck you bitch and i don't like you
what i might as well give this up but that'd be selfish as fuck
to leave d12 in this but we can't selfdestruct
i've never felt it this much c'mon fellas get up
we gotta fight like bugz last night of his life c'mon
i walk with a limp pistol hanging off of the hip
i'm awkward and quick enough and sick when sparking a fifth
your carcass is split even if beef is partially thick
we can't take you seriously you a comedy skit
you probably wish that you could be out shooting at g's
but the only thing you shoot is the breeze i can't believe
you speaking on moving keys but every time we hear you kick it
the only thing that you selling is woof tickets
i look wicked 'cause niggas'll test your nutsack
so when they bust you better bust back or get your guts clapped outta your stomach
and when they want it i'll bring a hundred niggas from runyon so get to gunnin' if you coming
i never would've dreamed in a million years i'd see
so many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
it's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
so many lives i touched so much anger aimed
in no particular direction just sprays and sprays
and straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
'til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
who would've thought standin' in this mirror bleachin' my hair
with some peroxide reachin' for a tshirt to wear
that i would catapult to the forefront of rap like this
how could i predict my words would have an impact like this
i must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'cause congress keep tellin' me i ain't causin' nothin' but problems
and now they're sayin' i'm in trouble with the government
i'm lovin' it i shoveled shit all my life and now i'm dumpin' it on
look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself
if they were brown shady'd lose shady sits on the shelf
but shady's cute shady knew shady's dimples would help
make ladies swoon baby ooh baby  look at my sales
let's do the math if i was black i would've sold half
i ain't have to graduate from lincoln high school to know that
but i could rap so fuck school i'm too cool to go back
give me the mic show me where the fuckin' studio's at
when i was underground no one gave a fuck i was white
no labels wanted to sign me almost gave up i was like
fuck it until i met dre the only one to look past
gave me a chance and i lit a fire up under his ass
helped him get back to the top every fan black that i got
was prob'ly his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
like damn we just swapped sittin' back lookin' at shit wow
i'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now it's
see the problem is i speak to suburban kids
who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
whose moms prob'ly would've never gave two squirts of piss
'til i created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
straight out the tube right into your livin' rooms i came
and kids flipped when they knew i was produced by dre
that's all it took and they were instantly hooked right in
and they connected with me too because i looked like them
that's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
searchin' with a fine tooth comb it's like this rope
waitin' to choke tightenin' around my throat
watchin' me while i write this like i don't like this note
all i hear is lyrics lyrics constant controversy
sponsors workin' 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
surely hiphop was never a problem in harlem only in boston
after it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
so now i'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
actin' like i'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say faggot shit
just look at me like i'm your closest pal
the poster child the motherfuckin' spokesman now for
have you ever been hated or discriminated against
i have i've been protested and demonstrated against
picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times
sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
all this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
not takin' nothin' from no one give 'em hell long as i'm breathin'
keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
see they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out
look at me now i bet you're prob'ly sick of me now
ain't you mama i'ma make you look so ridiculous now
i got some skeletons in my closet
and i don't know if no one knows it
so before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
i'ma expose it i'll take you back to '73
before i ever had a multiplatinumselling cd
i was a baby maybe i was just a couple of months
my faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
cause he split i wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
no i don't on second thought i just fuckin' wished he would die
i look at hailie and i couldn't picture leavin' her side
even if i hated kim i'd grit my teeth and i'd try
to make it work with her at least for hailie's sake
i maybe made some mistakes
but i'm only human but i'm man enough to face 'em today
what i did was stupid no doubt it was dumb
but the smartest shit i did was take the bullets out of that gun
cause i'da killed 'em shit i woulda shot kim and him both
it's my life i'd like to welcome y'all to the eminem show
now i would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
but put yourself in my position just try to envision
witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
goin' through public housing systems
victim of mnchausen's syndrome
my whole life i was made to believe i was sick when i wasn't
'til i grew up now i blew up
it makes you sick to your stomach doesn't it
wasn't it the reason you made that cd for me ma
so you could try to justify the way you treated me ma
but guess what you're gettin' older now
and it's cold when you're lonely
and nathan's growin' up so quick
he's gonna know that you're phony
and hailie's gettin' so big now you should see her she's beautiful
but you'll never see her she won't even be at your funeral haha
see what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
bitch do your song keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom
but how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
you selfish bitch i hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
remember when ronnie died and you said you wished it was me
well guess what i am dead dead to you as can be
never been the type to bend or budge
the wrong button to push no friend of bush
i'm the centerpiece you're a maltese
i'm a pitbull off his leash all this peace talk can cease
all these people i had to leave in limbo
i'm back now i've come to release this info
i'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple
canibitch don't want no beef with slim no
not even on my radar
so won't you please jump off my dick lay off and stay off
and follow me as i put these crayons to chaos
from sance to sance awaawchaaw
yeah let your hair down to the track yeah kick on back boo
the boogie monster of rap yeah the man's back
with a plan to ambush this bush administration
mush the senate's face and push this generation
of kids to stand and fight for the right to say somethin'
you might not like this white hot light
that i'm under no wonder i look so sunburnt
oh no i won't leave no stone unturned
oh no i won't leave won't go nowhere
dosido oh yo ho hello there
oh yeah don't think i won't go there
go to beirut and do a show there haha
yeah you laugh 'til your mothafuckin' ass gets drafted
while you're at bandcamp thinkin' that crap can't happen
'til you fuck around get an anthrax napkin
inside a package wrapped in saran wrap wrappin'
open the plastic and then you stand back gaspin'
fuckin' assassins hijackin' amtraks crashin'
all this terror america demands action
next thing you know you've got uncle sam's ass askin'
to join the army or what you'll do for their navy
you just a baby gettin' recruited at 18
you're on a plane now eatin' their food and their baked beans
i'm 28 they gon' take you 'fore they take me
crazy insane or insane crazy
when i say hussein you say shady
my views ain't changed still inhumane wait
arraigned two days late the date's today hang me
nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me
nothin' soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
nothin' boosts me more or suits me beautifully
there's nothin' you can do to mestab me shoot at me woohoo
psychotic hypnotic product i got the antibiotic
ain't nobody hotter and so on and yadayada
god i talk a lot of hemdelaylalala
oochiewallawalla umdadahdadahda but you gottagotta
keep movin' there's more music to make
keep makin' new shit produce hits to break
the monotony what's gotten into me
drugs rock and hennessy thug like i'm 'pac on my enemies
on your knees got you under siege
somebody you would give a lung to be
hungary like a fuckin' younger me
fuck the fee i can get you jumped for free
yeah buddy laugh it's funny i have the money
to have you killed by somebody who has nothin'
i'm past bluffin' pass the ky
let's get ready for some intense serious assfucking
never was a thug just infatuated with guns
never was a gangsta 'til i graduated to one
and got the rep of a villain for weapon concealin'
took the image of a thug kept shit appealin'
willin' to stick out my neck for respect
if it meant life or death never live to regret what i said
when you're me people just wanna see if it's true
if it's youwhat you say in your raps what you do
so they feel it's part of your obligation to fulfill
when they see you on the streets face to face are you for real
in confrontation ain't no conversation if you feel
you're in violation any hesitation'll get you killed
if you feel it kill it if you conceal it reveal it
being reasonable'll leave you full of bullets pull it
squeeze it 'til it's empty tempt me push me pussies
i need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze
i love pissin' you off gets me off
like my lawyers when the fuckin' judge lets me off
all you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
i'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
i'm a lit fuse anything i do bitch it's news
pistolwhippin' motherfucking bouncers 6'2
who needs bullets as soon as i pull it you sweat bullets
an excellent method to get rid of the next bully
it's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
you can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
it's like pourin' salt in the wounds assault and get sued
you can smell the lawsuits soon as i waltz in the room
everybody halts and stops calls the cops
all you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
runnin' and duckin' out the hot rocks parking lot
you'll all get shot whether it's your fault or not 'cause i'm a
i spit it slow so these kids know that i'm talkin' to 'em
give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
i'm like a thug with a little bit of pac influence
i spew it and look how i got you bitches rockin' to it
you motherfuckers could never do it like i could do it
don't even try it you'll look stupid do not pursue it
don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
i spit the illest shit ever been dropped in twoinch
so tickytock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
listen to the sound of kim as she licks on a cock
listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
motherfuckers know that i'll never be marshall again
full of controversy until i retire my jersey
'til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
and lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
and put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity i'm a
i thought i had it all figured out i did
i thought i was tough enough to stick it out with kim
but i wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
i found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs
which should've been a reason enough for me to get my stuff
and just leave how come i couldn't see this shit myself
it's just me nobody couldn't see the shit i felt
knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when i fell
to catch me the minute shit was heated she just bailed
i'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself
i couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
turned around saw gary stashin' the heater in his belt
saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
i just sold two million records i don't need to go to jail
i'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
i need to slow down try to get my feet on solid ground
so for now
bury my face in comic books cause i don't wanna look
at nothing this world's too much i've swallowed all i could
if i could swallow a bottle of tylenol i would
and end it for good just say goodbye to hollywood
i probably should these problems are pilin' all at once
cause everything that bothers me i got it bottled up
i think i'm bottomin' out but i'm not about to give up
i gotta get up thank god i got a little girl
and i'm a responsible father so not a lot of good
i'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud
must be in my blood cause i don't know how i do it
all i know is i don't wanna follow in the footsteps
of my dad cause i hate him so bad
the worst fear that i had
was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass
man if you could understand why i am the way that i am
what do i say to my fans when i tell 'em i'm
i don't wanna quit but shit i feel like this is it
for me to have this much appeal like this is sick
this is not a game this fame in real life this is sick
publicity stunt my ass conceal my fuckin' dick
fuck the guns i'm done i'll never look at gats
if i scrap i'll scrap like i ain't never whipped some ass
i love my fans but no one ever puts a grasp
on the fact i've sacrificed everything i have
i never dreamt i'd get to the level that i'm at
this is wack this is more than i ever coulda asked
everywhere i go a hat a sweater hood or mask
what about math how come i wasn't ever good at that
it's like the boy in the bubble who never could adapt
i'm trapped if i could go back i never woulda rapped
i sold my soul to the devil i'll never get it back
i just wanna leave this game with level head intact
imagine goin' from bein' a noone to seein'
everything blow up and all you did was just grow up emceein'
it's fuckin' crazy cause all i wanted was to give hailie
the life i never had instead i forced us to live alienated so i'm sayin'
they call me superman
leap tall hoes in a single bound
i'm single now got no ring on this finger now
i'd never let another chick bring me down
in a relationship save it bitch
babysit you make me sick
superman ain't savin' shit
girl you can jump on shady's dick
straight from the hip cut to the chase
i tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face

we'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
you don't want that neither do i
i don't wanna flip when i see you with guys
too much pride between you and i
not a jealous man but females lie
but i guess that's just what sluts do
how could it ever be just us two
i'd never love you enough to trust you
we just met and i just fucked you
first thing you say i'm not fazed
i hang around big stars all day
i don't see what the big deal is anyway
you're just plain old marshall to me
ooh yeah girl run that game
hailie jade i love that name
love that tattoo what's that say
rot in pieces uh that's great
first off you don't know marshall
at all so don't grow partial
that's ammo for my arsenal
i'll slap you off that bar stool
there goes another lawsuit
leave handprints all across you
good lordy whoadie
you must be gone off that water bottle
you want what you can't have
ooh girl that's too damn bad
don't touch what you can't grab
end up with two backhands
put anthrax on a tampax
and slap you 'til you can't stand
girl you just blew your chance
don't mean to ruin your plans
some days i sit starin' out the window
watchin' this world pass me by
sometimes i think there's nothin' to live for
i almost break down and cry
sometimes i think i'm crazy i'm crazy oh so crazy
why am i here am i just wastin' my time
but then i see my baby suddenly i'm not crazy
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes oh no
my baby girl keeps gettin' older
i watch her grow up with pride
people make jokes cause they don't understand me
they just don't see my real side
i act like shit don't faze me inside it drives me crazy
my insecurities could eat me alive
but then i see my baby suddenly i'm not crazy
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes oh no
man if i could sing i'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
if i could hit the notes i'd blow somethin' as long as my father
to show her how i feel about her how proud i am that i got her
god i'm a daddy i'm so glad that her mom didn't reh tnaw
now you probably get this picture from my public persona
that i'm a pistolpackin' drug addict who bags on his momma
but i wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
cause there's a lot of shit i keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul
and just know that i grow colder the older i grow
this boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
and this load is like the weight of the world and i think my neck is breakin'
should i just give up or try to live up to these expectations
now look i love my daughter more than life in itself
but i got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
but i handle it well given the circumstances i'm dealt
so many chances man it's too bad coulda had someone else
but the years that i've wasted is nothin' to the tears that i've tasted
so here's what i'm facin' three felonies six years of probation
i've went to jail for this woman i've been to bat for this woman
i've taken bats to people's backs bent over backwards for this woman
man i shoulda seen it comin' what'd i stick my penis up in
wouldn't have ripped the prenup up if i'da seen what she was fuckin'
but fuck it it's over there's no more reason to cry no more
i got my baby maybe the only lady that i adore
hailie so sayonara try tomorrow nice to know ya
our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
and suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
it's like the greatest gift you can get the weight has been lifted and
i was born to brew up storms stir up shit
kick up dust cuss 'til i slur up spit
grew up too quick went through too much knew too much shit
corrupt and i'ma pour it on like syrup bitch
thick and rich sick and twisted mr buttersworth
dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
'til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth
and if i fumble a verse keep goin'
first take i make mistakes just keep it
no punches pull no punches that's weak shit
fake shit if i ever take shit i'll eat shit
wasn't for him wouldn't be shit
creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane
been here longer than anyone in the game
and i ain't got to lie about my age  but what about jermaine
fuck jermaine he don't belong speakin' mine
or timbaland's name and don't think i don't read
your little interviews and see what you're sayin'
and i'm a giant and i ain't gotta move 'til i'm provoked
when i see you i'ma step on you and not even know it
you midget minime with a bunch of little miniyou's
runnin' around your backyard swimming pools
over 80 million records sold
and i ain't have to do it with 10 or 11yearolds
second verse it gets worse it gets no better than this
amateurs drink veteran piss
from a dixie cup if you ever mix me up
or confuse me with a canibus or dre with a dupri
we'll rub it in every club you're in we'll have you blackballed
and make sure you never rap afuckin'gain
dre ain't havin' it long as i'm here to play devil's advocate
if there was some magic shit i could wave
over the industry that could save it when i'm gone
and buried to make sure the tradition carries on i would
if i could only use this power for good i wouldn't not even if i could
from the hood and i'm a hornet
and i'ma only sting when i'm cornered
and i'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning
and swing to knock somebody's fuckin' head off
cause i know if they get up i won't get a chance to let off
another punch i'm punk rock no one's punk
don't give a fuck whitepac so much spunk
when i was little i knew i would blow up and sell a mil'
or grow up to be attila go nuts and be a killer
and i'm something of a phenom one puff of the chron'
i'm unstoppable i'm alive and
on top again there's no obstacle that i can't conquer
so come along with us c'mon
now anybody who knows dre knows i'm about
fast cars and aliz partyin' all day
but i handled my business cause it's work before play
don't look for trouble but i'll serve you gourmet
however you want it you can have it your way
you fuck my night up i'ma fuck up your day
bullet with your name sendin' it your way
that goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
cause this is my space you invade it
live to regret it and you'll die tryna violate it
fuck around get annihilated eyes dilated
huh like my old lady
cause what you say is what you say sometimes what you mean
is two different things depending on your mood if it swings
think too many things little hit of dre's weed
i can do anything catch a contact
and i'm gone and i'm back i speed write
and my loose leaf's my launchpad  and i can pull any string
don't have to prove anything catch a contract
on your head you headed west talk shit about dre
you better get a vest and invest in something to protect
your head and neck  and it's back and forth
all day like red and meth i joke when i say i'm the best
in the booth but a lot of truth is said in jest
and if i ever do live to be a legend
i'ma die a sudden death five mics in the source
ain't holdin' my fuckin' breath but i'll suffocate for the respect
'fore i breathe to collect a fuckin' check
'til i collapse i'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'til the day that i drop you'll never say that i'm not killin' 'em
cause when i am not then i'ma stop pennin' 'em
and i am not hiphop and i'm just not eminem
subliminal thoughts when i'ma stop sendin' 'em
women are caught in webs spin 'em and hock venom
adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
amoxicillin's just not real enough
the criminal copkillin' hiphop villain
a minimal swap to cop millions of pac listeners
you're comin' with me feel it or not
you're gonna fear it like i showed you the spirit of god lives in us
you hear it a lot lyrics to shock
is it a miracle or am i just product of pop fizzin' up
fo' shizzle my wizzle this is the plot listen up
you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck
music is like magic there's a certain feelin' you get
when you real and you spit and people are feelin' your shit
this is your moment and every single minute you spend
tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
so while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'cause i'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
i got a list here's the order of my list that it's in
it goes reggie jayz 2pac and biggie
andr from outkast jada kurupt nas and then me
but in this industry i'm the cause of a lot of envy
so when i'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
that's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
you hate it but you know respect you got to give me
the press's wet dream like bobby and whitney  nate hit me
soon as a verse starts i eat at an mc's heart
what is he thinking how not to go against me smart
and it's absurd how people hang on every word
i'll prob'ly never get the props i feel i ever deserve
but i'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
if i ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
cause in my heart of hearts i know nothin' could ever be worse
that's why i'm clever when i put together every verse
my thoughts are sporadic i act like i'm an addict
i rap like i'm addicted to smack like i'm kim mathers
but i don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
so this is like a fullblown attack i'm launchin' at 'em
the track is on some battlin' raps who wants some static
cause i don't really think that the fact that i'm slim matters
a plaque and platinum status is whack if i'm not the baddest so
there's no mountain i can't climb
there's no tower too high no plane that i can't learn how to fly
what do i gotta do to get through to you
to show you there ain't nothin' i can't take this chainsaw to
rahhnnn fuckin' brains brawn and brass balls
i cut 'em off and got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
inside of a hall with my framed autographed sunglasses
with elton john's name on my drag wall
i'm out the closet i've been lyin' my ass off
all this time me and dre been fuckin' with hats off
suck it marshall so tell laura and her husband to back off
'fore i push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
and launch one of these russians and that's all
blow every fuckin' thing except afghanistan on the map off
when will it stop when will i knock the crap off
knocking hailie tell 'em baby my dad's lost it
it's like my mother always told me
rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana and codeine and
goddamn it you little motherfucker
if you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
uh fuck that shit bitch
eat a motherfuckin' dick chew on a prick
and lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
i'd rather put out a motherfuckin' gospel record
i'd rather be a pussywhipped bitch
eat pussy and have pussy lips glued to my face
with a clit ring in my nose than quit bringin' my flows
quit givin' me my ammo can't you see why i'm so mean
if y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my mo
i wouldn't have to go eeneemeeneemeinimo
catch a homo by his toe man i don't know no more
am i the only fuckin' one who's normal anymore dad
my songs can make you cry take you by surprise
at the same time can make you dry your eyes
with the same rhyme see what you're seein'
is a genius at work which to me isn't work
so it's easy to misinterpret it at first cause when i speak
it's tongueincheek i'd yank my fuckin' teeth
before i'd ever bite my tongue i'd slice my gums
get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
and die and come back as vanilla ice's son
and walk around the rest of my life spit on
and kicked and hit with shit every time i sung
like r kelly as soon as bump and grind comes on
more pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl
inside of a plane aimed at the world trade
standin' on ronnie's grave screamin' at the sky
'til clouds gather it's clyde mathers and bonnie jade
and that's pretty much the gist of it
parents are pissed but the kids love it
9 millimeter heaters stashed in twoseaters with meat cleavers
i don't blame you i wouldn't let hailie listen to me neither
yo i woke up fucked up off the liquor i drunk damn
i had a bag of the skunk won in last night's tunk
pussy residue was on my penis denise from the cleaner's
fucked me good you shoulda seen this
big booty bitch switch unbearable shit
french roll stylin' body like a stallion
sizin' up the figure while my shit gettin' bigger
debatin' on a fuck or do i wanna be her nigga
caressin' this bitch plus i'm checkin' out them tits damn
sippin' on that fine shit i ain't used to buyin'
i gotta hit it from behind it's mandatory
like takin' hoes' money but that's another story
for surely pussy on toast after we toast
her clothes fell like bishop in juice c'mere
the womb beater clean pussy eater insertin' my jock
in that spot hotter than the hottest block
don't stopresponse i got when i was knockin' it
clock's steady tickin' kinky finger lickin'
and can on semen's at my tip when she moans
i gotta slow down before i cum soon
and work that nigga like a slave owner yeah
when i dropped off my outfit she knew i wanted to bone her
she foamin' at them lips the ones between the hips
pubic hair's lookin' like some sour cream dip
without the nacho my dick hit the spot though
pussy tighter than conditions of us black folks
we in the final stretch c'mere the last part of sex
i bust a fatass nut then i woke up next holy
like what the fuck is goin' on here shit this bitch evaporated
pussy and all just picked up and vacated
and now i'm frustrated 'cause my dick was unprotected damn
and doctor wesley tellin' me i really got that shit fuck
now i don't wanna hit no woman but this chick's got it comin'
someone better get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach
and she's pregnant but she's eggin' me on beggin' me to throw her
off the steps of this porch my only weapon is force
and i don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
though what's she shovin' me for bitch doesn't she love me no more
wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door
man i'm this close to goin' toetotoe with this whore
what would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce
she's havin' another baby in a month and it's yours
and you found it isn't 'cause this bitch has been visitin' someone else
and suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips when you get back to michigan
now the plot is thickenin' worse
cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse
so you're paranoid at every little cold that you get
ever since they told you this shit you've been holdin' your dick
so you go to the clinic sweatin' every minute you in it
then the doctor comes out lookin' like dennis the menace hahahahaha
and it's obvious to everyone in the lobby it's aids sorry
he ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it sorry
so you jet back home 'cause you gon' get that ho
when you see her you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back yo
'cause you love her you never would expect that blow
obie told you the scoop how could she stoop that low
jesus i don't believe this bitch works at the cleaner's
bringin' me home diseases swingin' from obie's penis
she's so deceivin' shit this ho's a genius she g'd us
if i were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow
would you feel sorrow or show love or would it matter
could never be the leadoff batter
if there ain't shit for me to feed off i'm seesaw battlin'
but there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
there's too much on my plate
i done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
and not say what i got to say
what the fuck you take me for a joke you smokin' crack
'fore i do that i'd beg mariah to take me back
i'll get up 'fore i get down run myself in the ground
'fore i put some wack shit out
i'm tryna smack this one out the parkfivethousand mark
y'all steady tryna drown a shark
ain't gon' do nothin' but piss me off
lid to the can of whipass just twist me off
see me leap out pull a piece out
fuck shootin' i'm just tryna knock his teeth out
fuck with me now bitchlet's see you freestyle
talk is cheap
motherfucker if you really feelin' froggish leap
yo slim you gon' let him get away with that
he tried to play you you can't let him skate with that
man i hate this crap
this ain't rap this is crazy the way we act
when we confuse hiphop with real life when the music stops
ain't no gettin' rid of mcvay if so you would've tried
the only way i'm leavin' this bitch is suicide
i have died clinically
arrived back at my enemy's crib with hennessy
got drunk then i finished him
i'm every nigga's favorite archenemy
physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
i spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark diligently
i'm not what you think
i appear to be fucked up mentally endangered
i can't stay away from a razor
i just want my face in a paper
i wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres
i'll murder you i gauge and have me turn into
a mad man son of sam bitch i'm surgical
i'm allergic to dyin'you think not
you got balls we can see how large when the music stops
i was happy havin' a deal at first
thought money would make me happy
but it only made my pain worse
it hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dawg
and you ain't got nothin' left but your word and your balls
and you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
beggin' with their hands out
checkin' for your record when it's sellin'
when it ain't that's the end no laughs no friends
no girls just the gin you drink 'til your car spin
you think damn when you slam into the wall and you fall
out the car and try to crawl with one arm
i'm 'bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
if my funeral's tomorrow wonder would they even call
when the music stops
let's see how many of your men loyal
when i pull up lookin' for you with a pistol sippin' a can of pennzoil
i'm revved up who said what when lead bust
your head just explode with red stuff
i'm handcuffed tossed in the paddywagon
braggin' about how you shouted like a coward
bullets devoured you showered you niggas
if i was you niggas i'd run while given a chance
understand i can enhance the spirit of man
death itself it can't hurt me
just the thought of dyin' alone that really irks me
you ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
be smart and stop tryna walk how gs walk before we spark
hug the floor while we playin' tugofwar wit' your life
fuck a tour and a mic i'd rather fuck a whore with a knife
deliver that shit that coroners like
you hype poppin' shit in broad daylight nigga you're a goner at night when the music stops
instigators turn pits in cages
let loose and bit the neighbors wrist to razors
y'all don't want war y'all want talk
in the dark my dogs all bark like woof
proof nigga i'm a wolf
get your whole roof caved in like reindeer hooves
stomp the booth shake the floor tiles loose
the more y'all breathe shit the more i moves
it's hill streetthis is hardcore blues
put a gun to rap check in all our dues nigga
or make the news bet you all y'all move
when the uzi pop you better drop when the music stop
music has changed my life in so many ways
brain's confused been fucked since the 5th grade
ll told me to rock the bells
nwa said fuck tha police now i'm in jail
'93 was strictly rb
fucked up haircut listened to jodeci
michael jacksonwho gon' tell me i ain't mike
ass cheeks painted white fuckin' priscilla tonight
flyin' down sunset smokin' crack
transvestite in the front eddie murphy in the back
mop had me grimy and gritty
marilyn mansoni dyed my hair blue and grew some titties
ludacris told me to throw them bows
now i'm in the hospital with a broken nose and a fractured elbow
voices in my head i'm goin' in shock
i'm reachin' for the glock but the music stops
they said i can't rap about being broke no more
they ain't say i can't rap about coke no more ahh
slut you think i won't choke no whore
'til them vocal cords don't work in her throat no more ahh
these motherfuckers are thinkin' i'm playin'
thinkin' i'm sayin' this shit 'cause i'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it ahh
put your hands down bitchi ain't gon' shoot you
i'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you ahh
shut up slut you're causin' too much chaos
just bend over and take it like a slutokay ma
oh now he's raping his own mother
abusing a whore snorting coke
and we gave him the rolling stone cover
you're goddamn right bitch and now it's too late
i'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
i invented violence you vile venomous volatile bitches
vain vicodin vrin vrin vrin
texas chainsaw left his brains all
danglin' from his neck while his head barely hangs on
blood guts guns cuts
knives lives wives nuns sluts
bitch i'ma kill you like a murder weapon i'ma conceal you
in a closet with mildew sheets pillows and film you
fuck with me i been through hell shut the hell up
i'm tryna develop these pictures of the devil to sell 'em
i ain't acid rap but i rap on acid
got a new blowup doll and just had a strapon added
whoops is that a subliminal hint
no just criminal intent to sodomize women again
eminem offend no eminem'll insult
and if you ever give in to him you give him an impulse
to do it again then if he does it again
you'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth
bitch i'ma kill you i ain't done this ain't the chorus
i ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
a bloodstain is orange after you wash it
three or four times in a tub but that's normal ain't it norman
serial killer hiding murder material
in a cereal box on top of your stereo
here we go again we're out of our medicine
out of our minds and we want in yours let us in
know why i say these things
'cause ladies' screams keep creepin' in shady's dreams
and the way things seem i shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
these 80gs a week to say the same things tweece
twice whatever i hate these things
fuck shots i hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
just to argue with 'em 'cause their ratings stink
fuck that i'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
from fat bitch to all seventy thousand pounds of her
from principal to the student body and counselor
from inschool to before school to outta school
i don't even believe in breathin'
i'm leavin' air in your lungs
just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
okay i'm ready to go play i got the machete from oj
i'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
you faggots keep eggin' me on
'til i have you at knifepoint then you beg me to stop
shut up give me your hands and feet
i said shut up when i'm talkin' to you
you hear me answer me
dear slim i wrote you but you still ain't callin'
i left my cell my pager and my home phone at the bottom
i sent two letters back in autumn you must not've got 'em
there probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
sometimes i scribble addresses too sloppy when i jot 'em
but anyways fuck it what's been up man how's your daughter
my girlfriend's pregnant too i'm 'bout to be a father
if i have a daughter guess what i'ma call her
i'ma name her bonnie
i read about your uncle ronnie too i'm sorry
i had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
i know you probably hear this every day but i'm your biggest fan
i even got the underground shit that you did with skam
i got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
i like the shit you did with rawkus too that shit was phat
anyways i hope you get this man hit me back
just to chat truly yours your biggest fan this is stan
dear slim you still ain't called or wrote i hope you have a chance
i ain't mad i just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
if you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert you didn't have to
but you coulda signed an autograph for matthew
that's my little brother man he's only six years old
we waited in the blisterin' cold
for you for four hours and you just said no
that's pretty shitty man you're like his fuckin' idol
he wants to be just like you man he likes you more than i do
i ain't that mad though i just don't like bein' lied to
remember when we met in denver
you said if i'd write you you would write back
see i'm just like you in a way i never knew my father neither
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
i can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
so when i have a shitty day i drift away and put 'em on
cause i don't really got shit else
so that shit helps when i'm depressed
i even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
sometimes i even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
it's like adrenaline the pain is such a sudden rush for me
see everything you say is real and i respect you cause you tell it
my girlfriend's jealous 'cause i talk about you 247
but she don't know you like i know you slim no one does
she don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
you gotta call me man i'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
sincerely yours stanps we should be together too
dear mr i'mtoogoodtocallorwritemyfans
this'll be the last package i ever send your ass
it's been six months and still no wordi don't deserve it

so this is my cassette i'm sendin' you i hope you hear it
i'm in the car right now i'm doin' 90 on the freeway
hey slim i drank a fifth of vodka you dare me to drive
you know the song by phil collins in the air of the night
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
but didn't then phil saw it all then at a show he found him
that's kinda how this is you coulda rescued me from drownin'
now it's too late i'm on a thousand downers nowi'm drowsy

i hope you know i ripped all of your pictures off the wall
i loved you slim we coulda been togetherthink about it
you ruined it now i hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
and when you dream i hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
i hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me

hey slim that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
but i didn't slit her throat i just tied her upsee i ain't like you
cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too

oh shit i forgothow am i supposed to send this shit out
dear stan i meant to write you sooner but i just been busy
you said your girlfriend's pregnant now how far along is she
look i'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother i wrote it on a starter cap
i'm sorry i didn't see you at the show i must've missed you
don't think i did that shit intentionally just to diss you
but what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too
i say that shit just clownin' dawg come on how fucked up is you
you got some issues stan i think you need some counselin'
to help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
and what's this shit about us meant to be together
that type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
i really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
i hope you get to read this letter i just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself i think that you'll be doin' just fine
if you relax a little i'm glad i inspire you but stan
why are you so mad try to understand that i do want you as a fan
i just don't want you to do some crazy shit
i seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape but they didn't say who it was to
come to think about it his name wasit was you
i don't do black music i don't do white music no
i make fight music for high school kids
i put lives at risk when i drive like this
i put wives at risk with a knife like this
shit you probably think i'm in your tape deck now
i'm in the back seat of your truck with duct tape stretched out
ducked the fuck way down waitin' to straight jump out
put it over your mouth and grab you by the face  what now
oh you want me to watch my mouth
how take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn them around
look i'll burn your fuckin' house down circle around
and hit the hydrant so you can't put your burnin' furniture out
i'm sorry there must be a mixup
you want me to fix up lyrics
while our president gets his dick sucked
fuck that take drugs rape sluts
make fun of gay clubs men who wear makeup
get aware wake up get a sense of humor
quit tryin' to censor music
this is for your kid's amusement the kids
but don't blame me when little eric jumps off of the terrace
you shoulda been watchin' him apparently you ain't parents
so who's bringin' the guns in this country hm
i couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun
through customs over in london
and last week i seen this schwarzenegger movie
where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with an uzi
i see these three little kids up in the front row
screaming go with their 17yearold uncle
i'm like guidance
ain't they got the same moms and dads
who got mad when i asked if they liked violence
and told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
what about the makeup
you allow your 12yearold daughter to wear hm
so tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
when his bus driver's screamin' at him fuckin' him up worse
go sit the fuck down you little fucking prick
and fuck was the first word i ever learned
up in the third grade flippin' the gym teacher the bird look
so read up 'bout how i used to get beat up
peed on be on free lunch
and changed school every three months
my life's like kind of what my wife's like what
fucked up after i beat her fuckin' ass every night ike
so how much easier would life be
if nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me
i never knew i knew i'd have a new house or a new car
a couple years ago i was more poorer than you are
i don't got that bad of a mouth do i
fuck shit ass bitch cunt shoobydedoowop oops

cher her him is it you is it them
wasn't me slim shady said to do it again
damn how much damage can you do with a pen
man i'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
if you woulda been in my shoes who woulda thought
slim shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought
that woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
i just said it i ain't know if you'd do it or not
i sit back with this pack of zigzag's and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest mc on this on this earth
and since birth i've been cursed with this curse to just curse
and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensin' these sentences
gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
of this chest and i rest again peacefully peacefully
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone when you freaks see me out
in the streets when i'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
to not come and speak to me speak to me i don't know you
and no i don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
i'm not mr n'sync i'm not what your friends think
i'm not mr friendly i can be a prick
if you tempt me my tank is on empty is on empty
no patience is in me and if you offend me
i'm liftin' you ten feet liftin' you ten feet in the air
i don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit
i'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
i'm tired of all you of all you i don't mean to be mean
but that's all i can be it's just me
sometimes i just feel like my father i hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense it's constant
and oh it's his lyrical content
the song 'guilty conscience' has gotten such rotten responses
and all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me finger at me
so i point one back at 'em but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb it's the one you put up
when you don't give a fuck when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull 'cause they full of shit too
when a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on marilyn on marilyn and the heroin
where were the parents at and look where it's at
middle america now it's a tragedy
now it's so sad to see an upperclass city
havin' this happenin' this happenin' then attack
eminem 'cause i rap this way rap this way but i'm glad
'cause they feed me the fuel that i need for the fire to burn
and it's burnin' and i have returned
i'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
that i wish that i would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label let's stop with the fables
i'm not gonna be able to top a my name is
and pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
to cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
and i just do not got the patience got the patience
to deal with these cocky caucasians
who think i'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause i talk
with an accent and grab on my balls so they always
keep askin' the same fuckin' questions fuckin' questions

i'm waitin' for hell like hell shit i'm anxious as hell
manson you're safe in that cell be thankful it's jail
i used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
thirteen i was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
i used to get punked and bullied on my block
'til i cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
hey ma' ma'
i used to give a fuck now i could give a fuck less
what do i think of success it sucks too much press
i'm stressed too much cess depressed too upset
it's just too much mess i guess i must just blew up quick yes
grew up quick no was raised right
whatever you say is wrong whatever i say's right
you think of my name now whenever you say hi
became a commodity 'cause i'm whi
te cause mtv was so friendly
to me can't wait 'til kim sees me
now is it worth it look at my life how is it perfect
read my lips bitch what my mouth isn't workin'
you hear this finger oh it's upside down
here let me turn this motherfucker up right now
i take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
just to see if he's influenced by me if he listens to music
and if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim
and becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
scratches my name is slim shady
i been crazy way before radio didn't play me
the sensational scratch back is the incredible
with ken kaniff who just finds the men edible
it's ken kaniff on the internet
tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed
it's a sick world we live in these days
slim for pete's sakes put down christopher reeve's legs
geez you guys are so sensitive
slim it's a touchy subject try and just don't mention it
mind with no sense in it fried schizophrenic
whose eyes get so squinted i'm blind from smoke in 'em
with my windows tinted
with nine limos rented doin' lines of coke in 'em
with a bunch of guys hoppin' out all high and indoscented
and that's where i get my name from that's why they call me
i take seven kids from columbine stand 'em all in line
add an ak47 a revolver a 9
a mac11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
and that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
cause i'm shady they call me as crazy
as the world was over this whole y2k thing
and by the way nsync why do they sing
am i the only one who realizes they stink
should i dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings
it's why i tend to block out when i hear things
cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring ahh
so i just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
longer than the rumor that i was stickin' it to christina
cause if i ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
it'd be jennifer lopez and puffy you know this
i'm sorry puff but i don't give a fuck
if this chick was my own mother i'd still fuck her with no rubber
and cum inside her and have a son and a new brother
at the same time and just say that it ain't minewhat's my name
yo you might see me joggin' you might see me walkin'
you might see me walkin' a dead rottweiler dog
with its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
hollerin' at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'
or leanin' out a window with a cocked shotgun
drivin' up the block in the car that they shot pac in
looking for big's killers dressin' ridiculous
blue and red like i don't see what the big deal is
double barrel 12gauge bigger than chris wallace
pissed off 'cause biggie and pac just missed all this
watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
and get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
and amidst all this crist' poppin' and wristwatches
i just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
and walk around with an empty bottle of remy martin
startin' shit like some 26yearold skinny cartman goddamn it
an antibackstreet and ricky martin
whose instinct's to kill nsync don't get me started
these fuckin' brats can't sing and britney's garbage
what's this bitch retarded give me back my 16 dollars
all i see is sissies in magazines smilin'
whatever happened to wilin' out and being violent
whatever happened to catchin'
a good oldfashioned passionate asswhoopin'
and gettin' your shoes coat and your hat tooken
vanilla ice don't like me uhuh
he said some shit in vibe to spite me yo
then went and dyed his hair just like me haha
a bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
and run around screamin' i don't care just bite me nana
i think i was put here to annoy the world
and destroy your little fouryearold boy or girl
plus i was put here to put fear in faggots who spray faygo root beer
and call themselves clowns cause they look queer
faggy 2 dope and silent gay
claimin' detroit when y'all live 20 miles away fuckin' punks
and i don't wrestle i'll knock you fuckin' faggots the fuck out
ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
after they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck  blaow
look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
when you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road south of 10
and i don't need help from d12 to beat up two females
in makeup who may try to scratch me with lee nails
slim anus you damn right slim anus
i don't get fucked in mine like you two little flamin' faggots
is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me
you little groupie bitch get off me go fuck puffy
now because of this blonde mop that's on top
of this fucked up head that i've got i've gone pop
the underground just spunned around and did a 360
now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
oh he just did some shit with missy
so now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with mc getbizzy
my fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for 10 million
she must want a dollar for every pill i've been stealin'
shit where the fuck you think i picked up the habit
all i had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
which is it bitch mrs briggs or ms mathers
it doesn't matter your attorney fred gibsons a faggot
talkin' about i fabricated my past
he's just aggravated i won't ejaculate in his ass ugh
so tell me what the hell is a fella to do
for every million i make another relative sues
family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
all of a sudden i got 90some cousins hey it's me
a halfbrother and sister who never seen me
or even bothered to call me until they saw me on tv
now everybody's so happy and proud
i'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house hey
and then to top it off i walked to the news stand
to buy this cheapass little magazine with a food stamp
skipped to the last page flipped right fast
and what do i see a picture of my big white ass
okay let me give you motherfuckers some help
uh here xxl xxl
now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
aw fuck it i'll even buy a couple myself
back when mark wahlberg was marky mark fuckin' faggot
this is how we used to make the party start
we used to mix hen with bacardi dark
and when it kicks in you can hardly talk
and by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
and you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
and my prediction is you're gon' probably fall
either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
and everything's spinnin' you're beginnin' to think women
are swimmin' in pink linen again in the sink then in
a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished
you are now allowed to officially slap bitches
you have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
start a fight with the same guy that was smarteyein' you
get in your car start it and start drivin'
over the island and cause a 42car pileup
earth calling pilot to copilot
looking for life on this planet sir no sign of it
all i can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
and i'm so high that i might die if i go by it
let me outta this place i'm outta place
i'm in outer space i've just vanished without a trace
i'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
i'll be back in an hour or so
in third grade all i used to do
was sniff glue through a tube and play rubik's cube
seventeen years later i'm as rude as jude
schemin' on the first chick with the hugest boobs
i've got no game and every face looks the same
they've got no name so i don't need game to play
i just say whatever i want to whoever i want
whenever i want wherever i want however i want
however i do show some respect to few
this ecstasy's got me standin' next to you
gettin' sentimental as fuck spillin' guts to you
we just met but i think i'm in love with you
but you're on it too so you tell me you love me too
wake up in the morning like yo what the fuck we'd do
i gotta go bitch you know i got stuff to do
cause if i get caught cheatin' then i'm stuck with you
but in the long run these drugs are probably
gonna catch up sooner or later but fuck it i'm on one
so let's enjoy let the x destroy your spinal cord
so it's not a straight line no more
'til we walk around lookin' like some windup dolls
shit's stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur
shit six hits won't even get me high no more
so bye for now i'm gonna try to find some more
that's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
when you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
and tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
what's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend
screw it and what's a little bit of alcohol poisonin'
and what's a little fight tomorrow you'll be boys again
it's your life live it however you wanna
marijuana is everywhere where was you brought up
it don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
they tell you to stop but you just sit there ignorin'
even though you wake up feelin' like shit every mornin'
but you're young you've got a lot of drugs to do
girls to screw parties to crash sucks to be you
if i could take it all back now i wouldn't
i would have did more shit that people said that i shouldn't
but i'm all grown up now and upgraded
and graduated to better drugs and updated
but i still got a lotta growing up to do
i still got a whole lotta throwing up to spew
but when it's all said and done i'll be forty
before i know it with a 40 on the porch tellin' stories
with a bottle of jack two grandkids in my lap
babysittin' for hailie while hailie's out gettin' smashed
i get lifted and spin 'til i'm halftwisted
feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick
pen full of ink think sinful and rap sick shit
shrink pencil me in for my last visit
drink gin 'til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
hash whiskey and ash 'til i slap bitches
ask bizzy he's been here the past six years
mash with me again and imagine this
i fucked my cousin in his asshole slit my mother's throat

and bitches know me as a hornyass freak
their mother wasn't raped i ate her pussy while she was sleep
pissydrunk throwin' up in the urinal
you fuckin' homo that's what i said at my dad's funeral
that's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin' idiots still still
that's why the first motherfucker poppin' some shit he gets killed killed
that's why we don't call it detroit we call it amityville ville
you can get capped after just havin' a cavity filled hahahahahaha
that's why we're crowned the murder capital still still
this ain't detroit this is motherfuckin' hamburger hill hill
we don't do drivebys we park in front of houses and shoot shoot
and when the police come we fuckin' shoot it out with 'em too too
that's the mentality here here that's the reality here here
did i just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here huh
while i'm holdin' a pistol with this many calibers here here
plus a registration that just made this shit valid this year year
'cause once i snap i can't be held accountable for my actions
that's when accidents happen happen when a thousand bullets come at your house
and collapse the foundation around you and they found you
and your family in it goddammit he meant it when he told you
just let me lay back and kick some old simplistic pimp shit
on slim's shit and start riots like limp bizkit

used to be the type of nigga that was foldin' some ones
'til i met your fat mama now i'm rollin' in dough

you can't teach me a goddamn thing 'cause
i watch tv and comcast cable
and you ain't able to stop these thoughts
you can't stop me from toppin' these charts
and you can't stop me from droppin' each march
with a brand new cd for these fuckin' retards duh
and to think it's just little ol' me
mr don'tgiveafuck still won't leave
the mother did drugs hard liquor cigarettes and speed
the baby came out disfigured ligaments indeed
it was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
don't dare make fun of that baby 'cause that baby was me
i'm a criminal an animal caged who turned crazed
but how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised
so as i got older and i got a lot taller
my dick shrunk smaller but my balls got larger
i drank more liquor to fuck you up quicker
than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word
my morals went thhbbpp when the president got oral
sex in his oval office on top of his desk off of his own employee
now don't ignore me you won't avoid me
you can't miss me i'm white blondehaired and my nose is pointy
i'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
in plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happenin' to him
slim shady i'm as crazy as em
inem and kim combined the maniac's in
in place of the doctor 'cause dre couldn't make it today
he's a little under the weather so i'm takin' his place mmmmmmm
oh that's dre with an ak to his face
don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
i told you dre you should've kept that thang put away
i guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it eh
i'm a criminal
windows tinted on my ride when i drive in it go go go
so when i rob a bank run out and just dive in it
so i'll be disguised in it and if anybody identifies
the guy in it i hide for five minutes
come back shoot the eyewitness
fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
die bitches bastards brats pets
this puppy's lucky i didn't blast his ass yet
if i ever gave a fuck i'd shave my nuts
tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
you motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
to say the stuff i say so just tape it shut
shit half the shit i say i just make it up
to make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
and if it's not a rapper that i make it as
i'ma be a fuckin' rapist in a jason mask
y'all act like you never seen a white person before
jaws all on the floor like pam like tommy just burst in the door
and started whoopin' her ass worse than before
they first were divorced suin' her over furniture agh
it's the return of the ah wait no way you're kidding
he didn't just say what i think he did did he
and dr dre said nothing you idiots
dr dre's dead he's locked in my basement ha ha
feminist women love eminem
chicka chicka chicka slim shady i'm sick of him
look at him walkin' around grabbin' his youknowwhat
flippin' the youknowwho yeah but he's so cute though
yeah i probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
but no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
sometimes i wanna get on tv and just let loose
but can't but it's cool for tom green to hump a dead moose
my bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips
and if i'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
and that's the message that we deliver to little kids
and expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
by the time they hit fourth grade
they've got the discovery channel don't they
we ain't nothin' but mammalswell some of us cannibals
who cut other people open like cantaloupes
but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
but if you feel like i feel i got the antidote
women wave your pantyhose sing the chorus and it goes
will smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records nope
well i do so fuck him and fuck you too
you think i give a damn about a grammy
half of you critics can't even stomach me let alone stand me
but slim what if you win wouldn't it be weird
why so you guys could just lie to get me here
so you can sit me here next to britney spears
shit christina aguilera better switch me chairs
so i can sit next to carson daly and fred durst
and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
little bitch put me on blast on mtv
yeah he's cute but i think he's married to kim heehee
i should download her audio on mp3
and show the whole world how you gave eminem vd agh
i'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
all you do is annoy me so i have been sent here to destroy you
and there's a million of us just like me
who cuss like me who just don't give a fuck like me
who dress like me walk talk and act like me
and just might be the next best thing but not quite me
i'm like a head trip to listen to cause i'm only givin' you
things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
the only difference is i got the balls to say it in front of y'all
and i don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
i just get on the mic and spit it
and whether you like to admit it i just shit it
better than 90 of you rappers out can
then you wonder how can
kids eat up these albums like valiums
it's funny cause at the rate i'm going when i'm 30
i'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
pinching nurse's asses when i'm jacking off with jergens
and i'm jerking but this whole bag of viagra isn't working
and every single person is a slim shady lurking
he could be working at burger king spittin' on your onion rings
or in the parking lot circling screaming i don't give a fuck
with his windows down and his system up
so will the real shady please stand up
and put one of those fingers on each hand up
and be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
and one more time loud as you can how does it go
warning this shit's gon' be rated r restricted
you see this bullet hole in my neck it's selfinflicted
doctor slapped my momma bitch you got a sick kid
arrested molested myself and got convicted
wearing visors sunglasses and disguises
'cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
i'm dr hyde and mr jekyll disrespectful
hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
murdermurder redrum
brain size of a bread crumb
which drug will i end up dead from
inebriated 'til my stress is alleviated
how in the fuck can eminem and shady be related
illiterate illegitimate shit spitter
bitch getter hid in the bush like margot kidder
jumped out rrrah killed the bitch and did her
used to let the babysitter suck my dick when i was littler
smoke a blunt while i'm titty fucking bette midler
sniper waiting on your roof like the fiddler
y'all thought i was gonna rhyme with riddler didn't ya
bring your bitch i wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her
i lace tunes that's out this world like space moons
with a bunch crazed loons dismissin' brains like graze wounds
nothing but idiots and misfits dipshits
doing whippets passed out like sampler snippets
where's the weed i wanna tamper with it
i'ma let your grandpa hit it
lace it up with cocaine so he can't forget it
fuck it maybe i'm a bum
but i was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
so what i'm on is way beyond the rum
or any alcoholic beverage losing all of my leverage
went up inside the first national bank broke and left rich
walking biohazard causing wreckage smoked out like eckrich
dandruff's making my neck itch what the fuck give me the check bitch
you just lost your tip there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
slap dips support domestic violence
beat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence
i'm just joking is dirty dozen really dust smoking
if all your shit's missing then probably one of us broke in
my head's ringing like it was spider sense tingling
blitzin' like green bay did when they shitted on new england
i'm out the game put the second string in
this brandy got me swinging bobbing back and forth like a penguin allah allah
delinquent choking microphones with broken english
make your mama be like whoo this is good who sings this
slim shady his tape is dope i dug it
it's rugged but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit
it was predicted by a medic i'd grow
to be an addicted diabetic living on liquid triaminic
pathetic but i don't think this headache's ever vanishing
panicking i think i might have just took too much anacin
frozen mannequin posin' stiffer than a statue
i think i'm dying god is that you
somebody help me before i od on an lp
take me to er asap for an iv
motherfuck jlb they don't support no hip hop
they say that's where it lives
the closest they gon' come is 2pac
it's politics it's all a fix
set up for these white bluecollared hicks
it's to make a dollar off of black music
with a subliminal ball of tricks
for those who kiss ass and swallow dicks
i'm tired of backstabbin'ass snakes with friendly grins
i'm tired of committin' so many sins
tired of always givin' in when this bottle of henny wins
tired of never havin' any ends
tired of havin' skinny friends hooked on crack and mini thins
i'm tired of this dj playin' your shit when he spins
tired of not havin' a deal
tired of havin' to deal with the bullshit without grabbin' the steel
tired of drownin' in my sorrow
tired of havin' to borrow a dollar for gas to start my monte carlo
i'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off
i'm tired of jobs startin' off
at 550 an hour then this boss wonders why i'm smartin' off

havin' a lack of funds and resortin' back to guns
tired of bein' stared at
tired of wearin' the same damn nike air hat
tired of steppin' in clubs wearin' the same pair of lugz
tired of people sayin' they're tired of hearin' me rap about drugs
tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
sayin' they wasn't feelin' me on nobody's as ill as me
and i'm tired of radio stations tellin' fibs
tired of jlb sayin' where hiphop lives

cause she found out i was havin' an affair
with her 10yearold niece
nobody better test me cause i don't wanna get messy
especially when i step inside this bitch dipped freshly
new lugz give the crew hugs guzzle two mugs
before i do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
true thugs rugged unshaven messy scrubs
whippin' 40bottles like the fuckin' pepsi clubs

with a handcrafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when i ran past it
fuckin' felon headed to hell in a handbasket
talkin' shit'll get you your girl and your man blasted
kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in saran plastic
get your damn ass kicked
by these fantastic furious four motherfuckers
flashin' in front of your face without the grandmasters
slim shady ain't nobody iller than me

massive lead to leave your cabbage red
similar to your ass in a casket dead
drastic spread of acid heads

the shit is in my hands here's your lifespan
and for what your life's worth this money is twice than
grab a couple grand and lay up in iceland

i'm thirsty for this green so bad i'm dehydratin'
hurry up with the cash bitch i got a ride waitin'
shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin'
i want the whole pie i won't be denied nathan
maybe i need my head inside straightened
brain contemplatin' clean out the register
dip before somebody catches ya
or gets your description and sketches ya
then connects you as the prime suspect
but i ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
'cause i got a daughter to feed
and two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed
the best thing would be for me to leave taco bell
and hit up chess king and have the lady at the desk bring
money from the safe in the back stepped in wavin' a mac
cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
this bitch tried escapin' the jack
grabbed her by the throat it's murder she wrote
you barely heard a word as she choked
it wasn't nothin' for her to be smoked
then i slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
just then the pigs bust in yellin' freeze
but i'm already wanted for sellin' ki's
and a bunch of other felonies from a to z like spellin' bees
so before i dropped to the ground and fell on knees
i bust shots they bust back
hit me square in the chest wasn't wearin' a vest
left the house pullin' out the drive backin' out
blew the back end out this lady's jag started blackin' out
pulled the mac10 out
stuck it in her face shut your yackin' mouth
'fore i blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
drug her by her hair smacked her up
figured fuck itmug her while you're there jacked her up
stole her car and made a profit
grabbed the tape from out the deck and loft it
out the window like the girl in set it off did
jetted off kid stole the whip now i'm a criminal
drove it through somebody's yard dove into they swimmin' pool
climbed out and collapsed on the patio
i made it out alive but i'm injured badly though
parents screamin' johnny go in and call the police
tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace
tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
actin' like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
smashed the window grabbed the nintendo 64
when they sell out in stores the price triples
i ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
and collided with an eightyyearold lady with groceries
there goes cheese eggs milk and post toasties
stood up and started to see stars
too many siren sounds it seemed like a thousand police cars
barely escaped musta been some dumb luck
jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
but i think somebody seen me maybe
plus i lost the damn nintendo and i musta dropped a beanie baby
fuck it i give up i'm surrounded in blue suits
came out with a white flag hollerin' trucetrucedon't shoot
and surrendered my weapon to cops
wasn't me it was the gangster rap and the peppermint schnapps
slim shady brain dead like jim brady
i'm a m80 you little like that kim lady
i'm buzzin' dirty dozen naughty rotten rhymer
cursin' at you players worse than marty schottenheimer
you wacker than the motherfucker you bit yo' style from
you ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
admit it fuck it while we comin' out in the open
i'm doin' acid crack smack coke and smokin' dope then
my name is marshall mathers i'm an alcoholic hi marshall
i have a disease and they don't know what to call it
better hide your wallet 'cause i'm comin' up quick to strip yo' cash
bought a ticket to yo' concert just to come and whip yo' ass
bitch i'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make yo' eyes spin
you gettin' knocked the fuck out like mike tyson pssh
the proof is in the puddin' just ask deshaun holton
i'll slit yo' motherfuckin' throat worse than ron goldman
i'm nicer than pete but i'm on a search to crush a milkbone
i'm everlastin' i melt vanilla ice like silicone
i'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
i'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
flavor with no seasoning this is the sneak preview
i'll diss yo' magazine and still won't get a weak review
i'll make yo' freak leave you smell the folgers crystals
this is lyrical combat gentlemen hold your pistols
but i form like voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
slim shady mm was the old initials byebye
extortion snortin' supportin' abortion
pathological liar blowin' shit outta proportion
the looniest zaniest spontaneous sporadic
impulsive thinker compulsive drinker addict
half animal half man
dumpin' yo' dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
with more holes than an afghan
somebody let me out this limousine hey let me out
i'm a caged demon
on stage screamin' like rage against the machine
i'm convinced i'm a fiend
shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
clinically braindead i don't need a second opinion

i'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher
i can't take the pressure i'm sick of bitches
sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while i'm washin' dishes
in school i never said much too busy havin' a head rush
doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
then i went to jim beam that's when my face grayed
went to gym in eighth grade  the women's swim team
don't take me for a joke i'm no comedian
too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
i'm goin' up over the curb drivin' on the median
finally made it home but i don't got the key to get in

and spilled ketchup on her shirt
mama's messy ain't she we'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves can't we
see honey there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
a place called prison and a place called jail
and dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
and you don't want a brother do ya nah
maybe when you're old enough
to understand a little better i'll explain it to ya

ayo my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
to get your brain relaxin' the zany actin' maniac in action
a brainiac in fact son you mainly lack attraction
you look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks runs
my rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
i travel through your mind and chill your spine like siren drills
i'm slimin' grills of roaches with spray that disinfects
and twistin' necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
put this in decks and check the monologue turn your system up
twist 'em up and indulge in the marijuana smog
this is the season for noise pollution contamination
examination of more cartunes than animation
my lamination of narerration hits a snare and bass
on a track for duck rapper interrogation
when i declare invasion there ain't no time to be starin' gazin'
i turn the stage into a barren wasteland
i'm infinite
bust it i let the beat commence
so i can beat the sense in your elite defense
i got some meat to mince
some fruit to stomp and then two feet to rinse
i greet the gents and ladies i spoil loyal fans
i foil plans and leave fluids leakin' like oil pans
my coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
one thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeepfull of people
mc's are feeble i came to cause some pandemonium
battle a band of phony mc's and stand the lonely one
imitator intimidator stimulator
simulator of data eliminator
there's never been a greater since the burial of jesus
fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
my thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces
my acappella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis
it eases you mentally gently
sentimentally instrumentally
with entity dementedly meant to be infinite
man i got evidence i'm never dense and i've been clever ever since
my residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the mo mo mo mo
so i'm assumin' all responsibility
'cause there's a monster real in me that always wants to kill mc's
mic nestler slammin' like a wrestler
here to make a mess of a lyricsmugglin' embezzler
no one is specialer my skill is intergalactical
i get cynical act a fool then i send a crew back to school
i never packed a tool or acted cool it wasn't practical
i'd rather let a tactical tactful track tickle your fancy
in fact i can't see or can't imagine
a man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
so this is for my family the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
plus the man who never had a plan b be all you can be
cause once you make an instant hit i'm tensed a bit
and tempted when i see the sins my friends commit
i'm infinite
one day i plan to be a family man happily married
i want to grow to be so old that i have to be carried
'til i'm glad to be buried and leave this crazy world
and have at least a half a million for my baby girl
it may be early to be plannin' this stuff
'cause i'm still strugglin' hard to be the man and it's tough
'cause man it's been rough but still i manage enough
i've been taken advantage of
damaged and scuffed my hands have been cuffed
but i don't panic and huff frantic and puff or plan to give up
the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
i'm antein' up double or nothin'
i've been troubled enough and
i'm sick of strugglin' and sufferin'
see my destiny's to rest at ease
'til i'm impressed and pleased
with my progress i won't settle for less than cheese
i'm on a quest to seize all my own label to call
way before my baby is able to crawl
i'm too stable to fall the pressure motivates
to know i hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
i see the golden gates to heaven on earth
where they don't pull a weapon on you
when you're steppin' on turf kyu
i'm goin' for broke gamblin' and playin' for keeps
every day in the streets scramblin' and payin' for cheap
prayin' for sleep dreamin' with a waterin' mouth
wishin' for a better life for my daughter and spouse
in this slaughterin' house
caught up in bouts with the root of all evil
i've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
and make them do shit illegal for these grants and jacksons
these transactions explain a man's actions
but in the midst of this insanity i found my christianity
through god and there's a wish he granted me
he showed me how to cope with the stress
and hope for the best instead of mope and depressed
always gropin' a mess of flyin' over the nest
to sellin' dope with the rest
i quit smokin' cess to open my chest
life is stressful inside this cesspool
tryin' to wrestle i almost bust a blood vessel
my little brother's tryin' to learn his mathematics
he's asthmatic runnin' home from school away from crack addicts
kids attract static children with automatics
takin' target practice on teens for starter jackets
i'm usin' smarter tactics to overcome this slum
i won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
it's cumbersome i'm tryin' to do well on this earth
but it's been hell on this earth since i fell on this earth
i'm givin' mad love i'm snugglin' hugs
strugglin' thugs smugglin' drugs
jugglin' jobs guzzlin' jugs
so here's a toast to federal checks
hetero sex unaffordable medical debts
we travel in packs unravelin' facts
and gravel in cracks to find babblin' max gafflin' tracks
i grapple an axe for them bafflin' acts
of mysterious stabinthebacks who dabble in wax
stealin' my art when i sculpt it
the culprit that stole shit'll end up with his skull split
then i buried the hatchet i carry the fat shit
butterfingers is here when it's necessary to scratch it
baby all i wanna do is swallow one or two
smoke a little bit and follow one of you
back home when the party ends
so tonight i'm droppin' naughty hints
to the finest women in the audience
ayo biters are like tarantulas vandalous
livin' as scandalous as a television evangelist
but i can handle this i'm the rhyme biter crime fighter
caped crusader takin' care of undeservin' lime lighters
i think we live an era meant for me
experimentally i found a way to spread the terror mentally
when i stumbled upon his resolution
by usin' a special fusion of chemical solution for this fresh illusion
you couldn't see me with binoculars
i'm armed like an octopus
step on stage and you'll get socked and pushed
talkin' that junk like you had black bart at your back
come to battle me and you get smacked hard as you act
when i reparesent it and will have a referee in it
every minute so when i win it you never resent it
i'm forever demented
come up with funk i'll never be scented
you got the point when i cleverly sent it
eminem is headed skyward
for those who thought that i would
make you bored and treat you like a piece of plywood
i've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
with the agility to escape a killer bee colony
so get your cameras and capture how miraculous
i rap for all you draculas
and showed you all how wack you was
i meant it as a diss
cause you don't posses the pizazz of this
i'm hazardous enough already as it is
without you addin' fuel to the fire i'm cruel to the liar
who fails to recognize my reign and hail rule to the sire
clinical studies show that i'm cynical
there's no one who's identical
to my fresh and authentic flow
i'm sure the party people can agree
that i'm enchantin' rhythm romantically
freakin' vocals so frantically
so throw your hands up in the atmosphere
and let them know the only party that was phat was here
yo some people say i'm whack now if that's right i'm
the freshest whack mc that you ever heard in your lifetime
my slick acapella sounds clever with the beats boy
i'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
forget a gold digger's succubus
my soul's thick with ruggedness
with the mic i'm like a dyke can't no nigga fuck with this
i got more different strokes than philip drummound
on open mic i bone your woman
just to keep my lyrics comin' bitch
we elevated to new heights premeditated
let it be that i stated they hate it
now that they see that i made it
the escalated can be put to the test of greatness
snatch the heart from mc's and i ate it
so i take it that's the reason i'm hated
to represent's my temperament
if rap was a dick all you so called hard mcs would not be impotent but pimpin' it
and actin' like you could rock a show
harder than ll's rock the bells and you's a ho
everything that you collaborate i lacerate
my rhymes they keep comin'
like nymphomaniacs that masturbate
at a faster rate yeah i got somethin' for your ass to hate
i blast your hate and have you all runnin' past the gates
and as for face clutchin' and touchin' the flows
i got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
buckin' these hoes i got that shit down to a science
leavin' them hot and bothered turned on like an appliance
defiance no we won't have that
you want your shit to blow up
well i'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
and blast that shit to kingdom come
then bring them some of this real hiphop
i drop beats and you ain't singin' or gonna do a thing but run
and you all knew from meeko
that you couldn't hold your own
with the strength of lou ferrigno
so stop that bullshit flow yo
you need to come with the real skills and act like you know
so what you know about a sweet mc in the 313
you don't know shit so when you see one flee
you can be rund you'll never be the mc
i stopped the alphabet at s and got it down to a t
i'm sure you're bound to agree a sweet mc crash the spot
i'll make the roof hot like i was rock master scott
your ass forgot so just in case you don't remember me
i'll run your brain round the block to jog your fuckin' memory
it's either them or me man kill or be killed
your will'll be sealed your casket closed you still'll be billed
my facilities filled with fans packed to capacity
i'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
if he's actin' soft and he cowers he better come cleaner
than jeru jackin' off when he showers
you flowers got no clout with a thing
you could date a stick of dynamite
and wouldn't go out with a bang
i shout with a slang simple as abcs
skip over the ds and rock the microphone with ease
dethrone mcs and i'ma max alone
relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
so facts are known biters get treated with shots
i rock a beat harder than you could beat it with rocks
i'm greeted with flocks of fellow followers' singers
you couldn't make the fans throw up their hands
if they swallowed their fingers
but you can bring yours let's see what you got
but don't front and never try to be what you're not
'cause you can be quick
jump the candlestick burn your back
and fuck jill on a hill but you still ain't jack
i know this crack fiend maxine who needs a vaccine
she tests positive but tells you that her act's clean
plus she got a sugar daddy
gassin' every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
if you mistook her sadly on her reputation
you're in jeopardation if you ain't got no preparation
when you stepped away son she got her face done
lookin' provocative she'll let you knock it if
you press the issue and get undressed to kiss you
if you match the price otherwise she won't look at you twice
but when you catch the lice or get the urgency
to go to the emergency 'cause it burns to pee
don't bring your germs to me 'cause i ain't tryna hear it
while you're fightin' your fuckin' disease tryna clear it
sometimes i wonder what's your purpose in life
that is to get with every brother
and unveil one of his kids
shit you livin' trife
got three kids at home and clubhoppin' every night
you say it's gonna stop
but it just slows down
and then speeds back to a regular pace
there is no end to this
mystery whatever your reason even is to be
you say you wanna be with me but how can you say that
when you got niggas hidin' in your closet
i refrain from gettin' angry
but you keep on actin' strangely
i met this girl last week
she was a freak and she liked me
so i stepped on it and then asked my homies
and chilled on the side and then watched they niggas
big game over there and take notes while i get this number
i stepped to her first i cleared my throat
and said hey bitch haven't i seen you before
looked at my nigga turned around and got slapped
throughout my hands and said oh it's like that
she said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
she started cryin' and asked me to forgive her and shit
she said her name was maxine
so i told her i wanted her number
she asked could i give her mine too
got to the crib and called her up
we got into a good conversation
that's when she asked me could i fuck
i said maxine check this out
give me your address i'll be through and you'll find out
got to the crib she let me in
she didn't waste time she grabbed my hand
and proceeded to the bedroom
i said hold up and stop proceedin' you rushin' things
what the fuck are you doin'
so i went for my protection
took off my clothes and started flexin'
as she went for my midsection
i threw her down as i tore off her shirt
pulled out my jimmy and i thought about puttin' in work
before i hit it she said 3 don't get mad
but there's somethin' that i gotta tell your ass
i said what is it another nigga it's okay
she said no i forgot to tell you
that i got aids i got a problem
i'll have you taken back to christ when you're sacrificed
the way you're hacked and sliced
when i fill your back with knives
jackin' life's of mc's now i'm set to launch a plan
for blowin' up the stage with illegal contraband
i stomped your man so unless you want what he got
you better set the mic down i'm steamin' like a teapot
i make the d hot people get in my face and ask
if i wanna battle then i chase them in a jason mask
it's an amazin' task to battle with success
i never gave a fuck now i give a fuck less
and win a slug fest i get physical like physicians
invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
wicked wizardry like a sorcerer no remorse for you
when i torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
so feel the force of my spiritual images
slicin' up an enemy's appendages 'til he hemorrhages
my skin itches every time a rapper recites
and when he's through with his verse
i'm all covered in flea bites
you wanna see fights i got a match for ya
you couldn't flip shit playin' in toilets with a spatula
you bitches get a hysterectomy disrespectin' me
you wanna feel the full effect of me hand a tec to me
intellectually superior i'll make the whack wearier
inferior deterior rate like bacteria
materially killin' serially clearly you'll see
how much in fear when you hear me you'll be
shiver and shake quiver and quake
bite a rhyme and feel your jaw get stiffer and ache
wither and break you slitherin' snake
gibberin' fake fibber and flake
i'll twist you in a different shape
and toss you in michigan lake for fisherman sake
if this is a dream you wish you can wake
every diss you can take personal
we ain't friends tryin' to make amends
if you ain't ever stole a gate you can take offense
i make intense masterpieces
and smash to pieces your last releases
you pass diseases that's the reason
i'm showin' you the proper way to
operate a mic so pass it like a hot potato
i've never been less than clever and fresh
severin' flesh of fools who never impressed ever infest
'cause all i do is yearn a life without a concern
and dream of havin' a turn to earn money to burn
mappin' out my strategies to get rich huh
my desire's like a scratch that needs to get itched huh
'cause man i live in the d this shit ain't given for free
nothin' is different to me so what else is there to see
i'll be the prisoner to flee from all of this misery
i'm not wishin' to be another fish in the sea
but just an mc so listen to me for this and agree
you're missin' the key you ain't even in the vicinity
unconditionally my aspects to cash checks
my objects were never to swab decks
it's up to you the decision is yours
if what you vision is tours or a missionless course
when your shit is in the stores 'cause you can be a star
yo i'm not about to chance it and dismiss handlin' business
i'm cancelin' christmas to gamble and risk this
financial interest is the matter at hand
i got an adequate plan for stab at a grand
i grab what i can and do what i must
pursue what i lust it's true that i just
choose the few that i trust
them's the people that i still got
fuck with gangsta philpot get your grill shot
the 5 ela for life my man thyme
proof kyu and denaun we move through in the nine
my crew's true and divine we never fronted
we just wanted to be funded and live to be a hundred
instead of hunted or bein' wanted as fugitives
it's all about a man plannin' what his future is
what he can do for his to be a star
i'm reminiscin' on your tenderness
and the snugglin' and teasin'
missin' what i remember
kissin' and huggin' and squeezin'
buggin' and wheezin'
i'm havin' trouble when breathin'
it's even tougher when sleepin'
but there's a couple of reasons that i'm sufferin' and grievin'
for lovin' and leavin'
you're all i'm thinkin' of in the evenin'
you got my knees bucklin' and weakenin'
thoughts of nothin' but freakin'
that i'm strugglin' to keep in
and interrupt when i'm speakin'
i got some game that i'm preparin' to run
the way your lips sparkle and they glare in the sun
you got your hair in a bun
no matter what you're wearin' you stun
'cause you're comparin' to none
i want to share in the fun i feel a passionate lust
when i imagine it just alone at last when it's us
i see you graspin' to trust
but my intentions are good let's leave the past in the dust
i'm not askin' to rush
and answer me immediately
i just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
if you agree to repeat after me
i love you i love you baby
'cause i just need you to see
how much i'm eager to be your man legally wed
your love's keepin' me fed
this is easily said so you can lead or be led
if you care to be down
'cause ain't nobody like you nowhere to be found
baby it's all on you it's you i call on boo
let's set a day up so you can fall on through
we'll take a spin in a lexus
you can chill for dinner and breakfast
long enough to see how this gentleman sexes
we'll start it off with caviar dom prignon
and then when it's a fact we are warm carry on
we'll take it slow see nobody will hurry things
i got the izze the bacardi and hurricane
if daiquiris are in debate and not your thang that day
it's still all right 'cause i got minute maid and tangeray
you're an incredible one that's rare
i bet in edible underwear
you'll look impeccable none compare
i dream of freakin' you the women that i'm speakin' to
it seems that there is not an end to things that we can do
so now we all set to play only thing left to say
is when you step away baby look over in the nglige
there's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
his face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
he'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
he's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
ring the alarm look for a man with green hair
check at your girl's house he was last seen there
he's has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes
good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks
we got the walkietalkies to keep us all informed
suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
our unit storms in we split the ghetto in sectors
lockin' down every block and put up metal detectors
protect yours and be sure that you stand close
watch each other's backs and guard your command post
and most of all be advised that he's wise
he could be disguised as one of your very own guys
i'm on a solo mission to find him personally
to settle the score and to beat him unmercifully
for what he first did to me it's sure to be the last
followin' footprints with a magnifyin' glass
to drag his lyin' ass back to his padded cell
i'm mad as hell on the trail of this tattle tail
i heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
give me your girlfriend or i'm gonna kill ya
i followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
sneezin' at dust and swingin' at the spider webs
inside the depths of his basement
i taste lint in my mouth
then the lights in the place went
i saw my life flash in front of my eyes
i felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
none of my guys knew where i'm at i was doomed
then i remembered the flashlight in my costume
dealing with backstabbers there was one thing i learned
they're only powerful when you got your back turned
i yearned for the day that we finally met again
so i can give him a taste of his own medicine
he shed his skin then he promised to come clean
i took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
cuffed him at the scene then dragged the fella home
beating him over the head with the telephone
i come home every single day from workin' double shifts
and stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
i come inside and you pretend you miss me
when you kiss me then you diss me
and we strenuously fight continuously
again you frisk me for numbers tryin' to bust me
it must be only just because you never learned to trust me
plus we only squabble over irrelevant issues
too many tissues for my feelings you misuse
i buy you jewelry you make a fool of me
i bring you diamond rings you say i'm bad at timin' things
so what's a man to do
when all i hand to you is handed back to me
you act to be this gangsta bitch
that ain't what first attracted me
i used to love your company
now youre always pumpin' me for information
and you tell your friends you plan on dumpin' me
so i'ma wait for your evacuation
cause every accusation
makes me wanna smack your face in
see i've never been so sure and you're just insecure
so my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
i recommend you take your things and check 'em in
look at the nervous wreck i'm in
i need my second windsay what
i used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
i used to be intoxicated with your sweet scents
until the day i started followin' your feetprints
and tappin' in your phone conversations
through the heat ventsit made complete sense
there's someone else you like
so i confronted you and asked you who was mike
and you was like i need a new nigga
someone rich that i could follow
and you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
leavin' me in sorrow brandy never felt so brokenhearted
i fell apart when you departed then the jokin' started
i was an open target you play comedian
and i became the laughing stock
but now i'm on my feet again
and so we meet again you're actin' like an exwife
all in my sex life i got a message from phife
it goes you didn't want me to see yo' hon
don't want me now take the towel wipe your brow
quit tryin' to hunt me down
you run me down and now your tryin' to apologize
for all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
because i got a bigger wallet size you wanna swing it
jealousy is in the house y'allfellas sing it

i'm sick of you bein' wack
and still usin' that mothafuckin' autotune
so let's talk about it let's talk about it
i'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
need to get the cock up out it
before we can even talk about it talk about it
i'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
that you're marshall mathers marshall mathers
don't mean you are and you're not about it
so just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it
i'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while i'm sleeping
i keep dreaming of death and i'm hearing people screaming
the devil's spirit's trapped inside me and i want it out
i'm on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house
with both of my wrists slit i'm lifted up in the air
and suspended in animation like someone's holding me there
i feel somebody's cold hands wrapping around my neck
while i choke on my own blood that i swallow and drown to death
but i found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches
nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes
tripping over od'd bodies of dead lushes
bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes
door's open and close by themselves
books fly off shelves curtains catch fire the house melts
my skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters
the wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters
caught a piece of shrapnel in the adam's apple
two cups of holy water and i'm looking at 'em half full
but as soon as i go to touch 'em they turn into red rum
it got silent then all these voices said
come follow me into the gates of hell
i heard 'em yell welcome to the norman bates motel
i ring the bell for service and i was greeted by his mother
covered in dry blood head still dented from the shovel
i said i need a room so i could try to get some rest
she gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess
and told me that's just for starters satan'll be in to see me later
to see if i'm interested in being partners
if we gotta dumb down our style and abc it
then so be it cause nowadays these kids just
dont give a shit 'bout lyrics
all they wanna hear is a beat and that's it
long as they can go to the club and get blitzed
pick up some chicks and get some digits
and the dj's playing them hits
oh this my jam this my shit
we don't know a word to a verse all we know is the chorus
cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
and the song's ginormous the whole formulas switched
cause we dont know anymore what are hits
is it the beat is it the rap
is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap
and how do we adapt and get trl votes
when thirteenyearolds control the remotes
and ashlee's got a brand new nose
we gotta put some new emphasis on our syllalables
if the emphasis on the compact disc
is in the beat then im gon' feature em and get rich
and let dre mix the shit and drive off in the range ro'
cause everywhere i go they love the blingbling flow
bangbang look at the way my chain glow
the ring on my fing cost your man a lot of dough oh
the fuck am i bustin' my brain fo'
it's just the way the game go and oh it takes two to tango
you call this a lame flow you bought the shit
i guess you to blame too i just found an angle hahaha
no more reality flow
im tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
cock the mac11 in front of hot 97
and call my publicist tell her we in press heaven haha
no one gives a shit except
some kids that just got into sex on the internet
so you want the chatroom or the house in malibu
em your emphasis is on the wrong syllalable
they said thirty's the new twenty funny
must mean forty's the new thirty interesting
'cause ever since then it's been in a sense an extension
for veteran rappers that are better than half of
the shit coming out right now it's all trash
the torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
jay said its his last then 50 and em
then what detox drops what do we got then
so now our whole camps is running around
scrambling over what to do
gambling every time we put a record out
just lookin' for that hook wait dre look
go shawty it's your birthday woo
you made it just in time to hear my wordplay
it's the kid that flip flows who used to flip o's
and run g for days you should see how i get hoes
i'm international i get my dick licked 'round the globe

im rosemarys baby i want you to hate me
they ask me am i okay they ask me if i'm happy
are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me
or am i just a little snappy and they genuinely care
doody most of my life it's just been me and you there
and i continuously stare at pictures of you
i never got to say i love you as much as i wanted to but i do
yeah i say it now when you can't hear me
what the fuck good does that do me now
but somehow i know you're near me in presence
oh i went and dropped some presents off for easter

minds a little and dog you'll never believe this
but sharonda actually talks to me nowjesus
and everyone else is just tryin' to pick up the pieces
man how could you touch so many fuckin' lives and just leave us
they say grievance has a way of affectin' everyone different
if it's true how the fuck i'm s'posed to get over you
difficult as it sounds
doody that's what we'd call each other
i don't know where it came from
but it just stuck with us we was always brothers
never thought about each other's skin colors
'til one day we was walkin' up the block in the summer
it was like 90 degrees i was catchin' a sunburn
tryin' to walk under the trees just to give me some comfort
i'm moanin' i just wanna get home and
i look over and your shirt is off
i'm like you're gonna fry you're like no i won't
i'm black stupid and black people they got melatonin
in their skinwe dont burn meanwhile my face is glowin'
and i feel like i'm on fire
and the entire time you're just laughin' at me
and snappin' at me with your shirt bastard
and i still have to get you back for that shit
and by the way them playboy rings my mother stole from you
well nate finally got 'em back shit
it must've been at least 16 years ago

the motor city motown hip hop vet
hip hop shop dreads it don't stop there
yeah as difficult as it sounds
and this might sound a little strange but i'ma tell it
i found that jacket that you left at my wedding
and i picked it up to smell it
i wrapped it up in plastic until i put it in glass
and hang up in the hallway so i can always look at it
and as for all me and d12 we feel like fuck rap
it feels like our general just fuckin' died in our lap
we shut off all our pagers all our cell numbers is changed
our twoways are in the trash
so some cats will have to find a new way
and i know it feels like the dreams will die with you today
but the truth is they're all still here and you ain't
purple gang you gotta keep pressin' on
don't ever give up the dream dog i got love for you all
and doody it's true you brought people together
who never woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
you were the peacemaker doody
i know sometimes you were moody
but you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding
but you was down for yours whenever it came to scrappin'
if it had to happen it had to happen
believe me i know you're the one who taught me to throw them 'bows back on dresden
from eggin' cars to paintballin' gettin' arrested
to sittin' across from each other in cells laughin' and jestin'
they tried to hit us for five years for that no question
i guess them hookers and bums that we shot up didn't show up for court so we got off on a technicality left sweatin'

shame he even came to your funeral he betrayed our team
and if i see him again i'ma punch him in the fuckin' face
and thats on hailie jade whitney laine and alainas name

in the air for you and pour some liquor out

so mom kicked me out and all i had in my suitcase
was one shoelace a tube sock and a tube of toothpaste
sometimes it was cool cause i could go to fred's
crash there fool around and just skip school
but other times i'd rather just be home
in my own room alone beat my shit and nobody would know
my little brother sucked on a bottle 'til he was six
so i'd hide it inside the couch and say
i don't know where it is
but as soon as mom found it i would either be grounded
or kicked out of the house a thousand weeks and still countin'
even when i was underage
mom was tellin' cops i was tryin' to run away
i told her someday bitch you're gonna pay
please mom please mom please i wanna stay

my brother's incoherent mom's a single parent
who ain't carin' starin' through me
like i'm transparent made it clear
that i was just there to run her errands
told her friends i was a son from her last marriage
sent me up to the corner store with a little note
please sell my stepson some cigarettes so i can smoke
one time i tried to fake sick to get attention
backfired mom sent me to school with a vengeance
my life's the worst thing that could ever happen to me
i go to class and every teacher's always laughin' at me
and mom says white rappers are laughed at
not only that she heard me upstairs

a head and torso of someone where'd it come from
who's it belong to maybe the girl with the long blonde hair
who disappeared and left her cheerleader pompoms
clearly there's somethin' wrong 'cause she didn't come home
she's missing where is she something fishy is going on
i guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs

put forthan effort one foot forward thank heavens
and good lord whoever would've thought
that my umbilical cord would ever get cut cut
from the ssame cloth as no other name
just be thankful that i came forth
tempered the same whether it's boiled or flame broiled
you say my name you bet that ass you gon' pay for it
just the respect it's not the crown that i came for
but if you feel like passing it around well then jay throw it
this way i'll go straight toward it if not i'll just wait for it
the other skateboard got a couple of scrapes

but i'll get up out it i always do
i ain't gon' sit here and argue about it

i just deflect it get cahis or 50's record and check it
and buck is out like get these motherfuckers out 'fore i smack 'em
plus ti just dropped an album now go out and get that one
and i got a whole stable of artists who's able and fully capable
of holdin' a label 'til i figure out when i'm ready to drop
or maybe not shady look how hot you were on top

you're a washed up entrepreneur how's it possible
well it's not if your little fickle minds would've caught on but you didn't
see i don't rap for the green i mean i ain't greedy
but i also know what it's like to be needy and i will never
go back to poverty see it ain't easy to try to step
away from entertainment separate it from cds

obie the person that came up introverted
'cause of nervousness that was solely the only verdict
it was worth it 'cause he changed became so observant
servin' such of a purpose
if you knew him earlier in his days it's like a different version
so much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
that's why it's curtains in this murder if you get him worked up
i'm so assertive on these muthafuckas acting tougher
had enough of isolatin' myself in a room
writing poems and songs doing the same in school
now look what he became a fool
'cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you
livin' hard but still julliard
a god walks and ain't spend a day in the pew
regardless of this i draw visual pictures when a nigga vents
so welcome to the art department
i stimulate the brain mimic emulate the sane
cynics keep on thinkin' it's a fuckin' gimmick when it ain't
clinically insane brain is on venus up uranus
label me a genius if you ever seen us you would say
he may seem as though he's plain normal if you ever meet him
greet him with a shake see he ain't as mean as what they say
see the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say
so he's vague so they mistake him for bein' crazed
you part ways your impression of him changed
you don't think he's strange you turn around and tell him peace and thanks
you catch him flippin' you off with his pants down
hands around his scrotum tuckin' his fuckin' penis between his legs
obie the person that came up introverted
'cause of nervousness that was solely the only verdict
it was worth it 'cause he changed became so observant
servin' such of a purpose

now who's the king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
who could inherit the title put the youth in hysterics
usin' his music to steer it sharin' his views and his merits
but there's a huge interference
they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
maybe it's hatred i spew maybe it's food for the spirit
maybe it's beautiful music i made for you to just cherish
but i'm debated disputed hated and viewed in america
as a motherfuckin' drug addict like you didn't experiment
nah nah that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrassed
and i got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents

jesus christ the king of these latterday saints here
to shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
as a monger of hate and satan a scatterbrained atheist
but that ain't the case see it's a matter of taste
we as a people decide if shady's as bad as they say he is
or is he the latter a gateway to escape
media scapegoat who they can be mad at today

now watch my brother bring all my diamonds to summer bling
while i'm climbing and fuck her
then tell you bitch to get off my yacht
yo i'm into voodoo tarot cards and ouija boards
lightin' candles campin' out at haunted beach resorts
i write the dark shit and rap about perverted violence
ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands
dressed in jean shorts high tops and tube socks
holdin' a rifle with a life full of drama like 2pac's
jumpin' off rooftops drunk after i do shots
landin' in someone's backyard gettin' chewed up by two rots
i got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks
this rap shit got cash comin' out the blue like nude cops
i use to sell pizzas now i got twelve visas
so tell jesus that i'ma quit sinnin' when hell freezes
yo i used to be too heavy in that cruising gratiot crap
i think i fucked my head up listenin' to acid rap
i go to parties bumpin' nasty nas's new song
and smoke pot 'til i get high and stare at shit for too long
like this weed is laced ain't it it tastes tainted
the whole place fainted i woke up with my face painted
spaced out like scifi tv fuck icp buy my cd yeah
that's what i'm screamin' while i'm handin' out promo tapes of my debut
tellin' bitches let me eat your pussy while i shave you
ain't no shame in my game i turn the party out
makin' everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth
it's been a little boring lately
i've been playing in poison ivy and pee
i've been itching to get in some shit
you heard what i said
this club i guess they id
but they just let me in without it so i guess they like me
i put on my best dang white tee for this evening's festivities
and i even got it pressed and drycleaned
it's me and the rest of my heathens we in the building
'til it closes we're partying 'til then nobody knows that i'm drinking
keep my bacardi concealed inside of my jacket
when no one's looking i tap the bottle crack it then swig it then put the frigging top back on it and cap it
yeah that same bullshit man i just got back on it god dammit
boy you don't want it doggone it that gin and tonic i slam it
an alcoholic i am what i am that's all that i am
and upon my further inspection monica's bra i examine
and if you're wondering why i'm looking in awe as i am
it's 'cause i'm just so overjoyed to see people brawl to my jam
and now let's go
man i hate it when no one's paying me any attention
so i won't let up 'til they do i don't have any intention
ma i like your breast but your booty's too skinny to pinch it
how is that possible with a waist on me about 26 inches
ease up on the henny just sip it
there's so many winches up in here that's got my interest
i'm drenched in sweat down in the trenches
continue to make my way all the way to the center of the dance floor i've just entered
hope that i don't get injured oh here i go
i'm shaking my tail for the ohso member
oh feet don't fail me now
better be nimble when you swoop this bimb' up
get the info on the nympho dudes went for 'cause of the way he pimped up
shady's mercedes benz with the crazy rims got the ladies trembling
like a gremlin with a head full of red bull at 1215 am and
dude i feel incredible is medicine edible you are unforgettable
girl the fact we didn't meet sooner is the only thing that i think's regrettable
let me check my schedule shit
oh no your phone number ain't even legible this night's unmeasurable
it'd be my pleasure to introduce you to
so when you come in the club don't care if you paid or you snuck in
soon as you hear the beat drop stop what you doing start buckin'
so get up like you're up and homie get down like you're ducking
up like you're stuck in the air and down like you're down on your luck
and not down like out so just turn that frown upside down that you're stuck in
there's no upside when you're down
the only downside when you're up is being hungover
so shady won't tell you 'em what's up
then go get your cup and refill it
now speed it up a little bit and just kill it
don't stand there and look at my whip chick get in
i ain't gotta tell you again now close the door you're lettin' flies in
what am i supposed to be air conditioning the whole outside then
would you look at what you're riding in
you better take pride and stare at it for five minutes
you're lucky i didn't just drive by in it
you're privileged just to be inside of it
i stepped in this party to liven it
i just caught a vibe in it the minute that i arrived in it
so ladies where you at make some noise if you're likin' it
then tell your boyfriend to take a hike again
two heinekens and you're mine
so slim shady won't you please step to the mic again come on
uh
what if i told you that i was different
what if i told you that something'smissin'
andwhat if itold you we're not alike
and theway that i feel inside is different than what you picture
what if i told you i feel divided
keep to myself and i'm awfully quiet
and what if i told you i been conflicted by my own thoughts
trapped in the dark and i tried to hide it
no i'm not a slave to no fuckin' fairy tale
i bet you think that you know me very well
make no mistake this is not a cry for help
'cause i don't owe no one no explanation on how i feel
yeah
what if i told you i'm not alright
i mean i don't feel dead but i'm not alive
and what if i told you i'm not like you
and the shit i've been goin' through it'll prolly make you cry
and what if i told you i'm not this
and the person you think you know don't exist
look i'm not who you know i'm not who you wish
i'm not who you want me to be what you want from me isn't this
i grew up in church where i couldn't be myself
i felt like a prisoner couldn't leave my cell
they told me god don't like ugly and this an ugly world
and if i ever seen things different then i would burn in hell
what if i told you i'm homophobic
and you have zero control over your impulses
and the genetic flaw in your chromosomes is the culprit
it's something i can't sugarcoat it's repulsive
we were homies since children i thought it
but thought i was buggin' though
'cause we'd sit chill and just talk chicks
now how can we be friends still after all this
unless i can convince you to repent
ask god to forgive you for your sins
and begin healin' your conscience
and rid you of this sick illness that causes it
part of me wishes you'd kept this shit still in the closet
i'm white but i'm gettin' mixed feelings like logic
yeah i'm pissed off a little this is a choice
we were supposed to be boys
you're actin' like this ain't optional
what if i said you was weak
'cause you don't got the strength to conquer some biological monster that's part of you
that's responsible for them homosexual thoughts
if you don't want a lecture part
like a sofa section or long as you
make your decision and stand by it but i can't be beside it
'cause for me that'd be next to impossible
or you learn to control your urges
you say it's like pullin' teeth and morals are oral surgeons
but how would you even know anyways if you're a virgin
why can't you be a normal person
what if i tried steerin' you towards a girlfriend
wouldn't work would it you seem pretty surefooted
i'm sure good at judgin' but i have no right
i know goodbye seems cold right
not even a flicker of hope like a strobe light
as i leave and i swear i stayed up that whole night
and no i didn't know you would go right home and go take your own life
i ain't mean for that shit to happen i said i won't cry
i let the best friend that i've ever known die
alone was gonna tell you the next day
i'm so sorry i'm fightin' my own demons i won't lie
they won't leave me alone eating at my soul this whole time
i've been tortured imprisoned in my own mind
a born again christian but lord if you're listenin'
we might be headed for a collision
'cause when i told my boy i couldn't support his decision
i was tryna make it seem like a choice when it isn't
can't be cured with a prayer to saint jude
what if i told you my wish never came true
what if i'm a hypocrite who's afraid to just face truth wait
what if i told you i'm gay too
this is a beat with no words at first its a blank painting
exercising the mind its brain strength training
it starts off something like shady's an insane maniac
yeah slim shady that's a zany name ain't it
now all you need's an image to go with the name baby
wifebeaters and white tshirts hanes mainly

women screaming his fucking name fainting
shady did it he sold out the whole dang stadium
joe shmoe made it he took his plain jane lady
and his baby hailie out the trailer but he ain't trailing anymore

and he's about to be raped by this game anally now
youre operating on all cylinders syllables spit like dillingers
spilling your guts people are feeling your mic skills
but these haters are ice grilling ya
willing to sacrifice anything for the life that they might steal from ya
fake friends will kill for ya die for ya but you cant decipher
why for the life of ya it wasnt like this when you were cyphering

nothing is private anymore oh and your best friend
say byebye to him what kind of apple you take a bite of slim
but this is what you wanted marshall ain't it fuck no
the way that it turned out was nothin' like the picture that i painted
in my head sometimes a dream and making it's more fun
than it's to actually make it the game stripped me naked
it robbed me of ever having another real relationship
with another girl this world is a fucking trip
as i slip in another world proceed take another hit

no sense screaming and arguing
makes no difference whether a benz or a bentley
or a bimmer's the car you in
you think you ball well i palm it
i throw up bombs when i vomit
boy i throw down in the kitchen
might hit your mom with my omelette
but you got egg on your face
now watch me drop an atomic
i should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze
bitch i'm as batshit as ozzy
it's obvious you can tell right off the bat
no pun intended but come any closer i'll bite off your head
tryna give me the finger's kinda like giving a spider the web
i'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage
i'll catch a fly in that bitch you think you fly you just food
i give as much of a flying fuck as that superman dude
guess i just do what you can't do
and make you look stupid and bamboozled
confused as usual and you can get whipped
she can open a can too
but you better hope you can handle the heat
or stay the fuck outta hell's kitchen
i came to cockblock like a square fucking male chicken
yeah it's shady slut the rest can suck on that big one
'cause i'm as despicable as daffy duck when i'm spittin'
i'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while i'm sleeping
i keepdreamingof death andi'm hearing people screaming
the devil's spirit'strapped inside me and i want it out
i'm on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house
with both of my wrists slit i'm lifted up in the air
and suspended in animation like someone's holding me there
i'm feeling somebody's cold hands wrapping around my neck
while i choke on my own blood that i swallow and drown to death
but i found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches
nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes
tripping over od'd bodies of dead lushes
bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red slushies
doors open and close by themselves books fly off shelves
curtains catch fire the house melts
my skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters
the wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters
caught a piece of shrapnel in the adam's apple
two cups of holy water and i'm looking at 'em half full
but as soon as i go to touch 'em they turn into red rum
it got silent then all these voices said come
follow me into the gates of hell
i heard 'em yell welcome to the norman bates motel
i ring the bell for service and i was greeted by his mother
covered in dry blood head still dented from the shovel
i said i need a room so i could try to get some rest
she gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess
and told me that's just for starters
satan'll be in to see me later to see to if i'm interested in being partners
well foolish pride has a lot of things to say
you got foolish pride like you got tooth decay
but tooth decay is another problem
so let's take this ole foolish pride problem and solve it
now when i talk about foolish pride
i mean blacks and whites taking different sides
when blacks and whites take different sides
unity never happens and we will subside
we will subside and hatred will release
and everything will just crush that peace
but when we crush that peace you see we start hatin' each other
but remember you are my brother and you are my sister
just like i'm a mister
i seen a black girlfriend and i kissed her
i kissed her i placed it on her cheek
and she didn't come back 'til next week
now it was next week and she was back again
wanting to kiss a white kid
so she was my girlfriend we started going out
but that's okay because we were black and white
blacks and whites sometimes mix
but black girls only want your money 'cause they're dumb chicks
so i'ma say like this
don't date a black girl take it as a diss
if you want but if you don't
i'ma tell you like this i surely won't
never date a black girl because blacks only want your money
and that shit ain't funny
so i'ma say look honey
why do you do this
you know you step up to me like you a brutus
then you try to grab my spinach
because it's green and that's cash
so get outta here 'cause i don't need your ass
i said that before but that's okay because like i said you're a whore
black girls and white girls just don't mix
because black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks
white girls are good i like white girls
i like white girls all over the world
white girls are fine and they blow my mind
and that's why i'm here now telling you this rhyme
'cause black girls i really don't like
we don't mix it's like riding a bike
when you're peddling hard uphill both ways
you know it's kinda hard and that's why i say to you
i'm giving you a little advice
don't date a black girl if you do it once you won't do it twice
you won't ever do it again because they'll take your money
and that ain't funny
so i'ma say look honey
i've already said that before
but like i said again you're nothing but a big whore
so when mike catch on the bass line
that's okay 'cause we will not just waste time
i'll get straight to the point black girls are bitches
that's why i'ma tell you you better pull up your britches
'cause all that cash is making your ass drag
from the boyfriend you ganked and that's pretty bad
i mean that's pretty sad when you're dating a black guy
and then you turn around and fuck another big black guy
now that's pretty wrong but you're just ganking
but that's okay because you need a god damn spanking
from me the funky mm
i'm busting rhymes and i'm swallowing phlegm
i'm busting a freestyle just like this
i say swallowing phlegm and howard gets pissed
but when howard gets pissed that's okay
because he leaves and he doesn't show up for two more days
so i'll just worry about that problem when i come to it
i'll cross that bridge when i come to it
'cause i forgot the chorus
but that's okay 'cause y'all saying bust a rhyme for us
so i'ma bust another rhyme about this black girl
she turned out to be a fuckin' wack girl
a wack girl because black girls ain't funny
all they want is your goddamn money
they take you for everything you've got
and then you stand with a bunch of snot in your hand
so i'ma kick it to you just like this
how does the chorus go i forgot
but that's okay 'cause i'ma tell you in stride
i'ma say ole foolish pride
a new day is now upon us the grass is green
it's time for the
tomakean entrance andput my foot forward
and take astep forward now take the scene
that's fine the setup  death rhymes
i got enough of that to last me a life time
the fuse it lit so now just stay clear from it
and prepare your ears
lyrics that are gruesome
i never askedto be
so don't blame mefor the crap i do
you're the one who made the choice to have me
i saw before  mom and daddy
i'm about to piss a lot of jealous people off
tell us  sleep it off
'cause you can hate it like
you probably gonna think that i'm talking
about you and you're goddamn right i am
look at you this is the minimal i could diss you
subliminally but i think criminal instinct
has pushed me to the brink my pussy does it stink
he still loves me 'cause he puts me in his ink
he does doesn't he still is isn't he
nah i'm just playing tug of war with his heart 'cause he misses me
i can still fuck him and leave him whenever i feel frisky
and there's no risk of disease 'cause he ain't with anyone is he
this bitch really thinks she can get me
if she still wants me driving across country
strapped up to the front seat missing all her front teeth
thinking to herself when's the next time he's gonna punch me
i told this cunt she's gonna overdo it once
and once she does she'll be stuffed up in a trunk
crunchy scrunched her up in a ball
bunched up nice and comfy
fuck around get dumped up in a lake 'fore you dump me
you cunning little cunt deceitful witch
you thought you had me till my shrink told me this
i feel like a serial killer i keep dumping bodies in the lake
i'mma get caught and sent up the river
i shiver when i think of the company i keep
how do i know she ain't gonna kill me when i sleep
i shriek every time she hands me something to drink
sex kept us together when we slept together everything
was all better she made me feel like a king
slowly she began lowering my selfesteem
she'd go to the club and not answer the phone when i call her
and i just bought her a truck for 50000 dollars
accused me of doing drugs and scream and holla
then i find a bag of coke on her some marijuana
and all i know is every time i go
to them hiding spots wherever she hides her blow
the little bags of dope there was a pile of coke
that's growing smaller and that was just a while ago
and i wouldn't even let on like i know
what was i supposed to do call her out on it we'd just argue
say she put it there on purpose and flipped the whole script
ooh she's a manipulative evil bitch
a cunning little cunt little deceitful witch
she thought she had me till my shrink told me this
ay this the dr in charge of saving artists out the er
bring them back to life beats like cpr
made the westside worldwide no pr
gangsta rap god i'm the end all be all
california love from the bloods to the cdogs
the compton monsters make you wanna cut your mp off
the greatest in the game haters should be ashamed
for not acknowledging the brain of the west coast king
brought chronic to the scene folded pills in the lean
now the game full of puppets look at me no strings
again and again i've shown you seen me
piss on niggas' egos ruin they self esteem
sky the limit no roof i can do what you dream
done it all 'fore you ever did a thing knamean
tees and black jeans no bling just bang
officially deranged clinically insane
look eazy ain't a damn thing changed i promise
still live like we did back with straight outta compton
taught niggas how to have attitudes on some hood shit
showed them what to smoke when they were blazing that bullshit
that's why you smell the drug aroma when my record play
not a blemish on my image decorated resume
a legendary legacy
all that i was you'll never be fuck is y'all telling me
forever on top
face it you'll never be better than the doc ask pac
again i say it's never gon' stop
face it you'll never be greater than the doc ask pac
my motto is live by the bottle so why is my supply low
bring in a truckload with a highlow
stay grounded but i still reach for the sky though
ghetto idol i think but what do i know
shit i know a lot more than i should
the hood stood by me just like i thought it would
don't act like i'm hollywood when i probably could
i don't polly muhammad ali of rap i don't lolly gag
west coast the home of the body bag
the shotty the mag los angeles where the party at
you can catch me anywhere where there's bacardi at
yeah andre is back so have a cardiac
started back with the black raiders starter cap
gangsta rap we practically fucking started that
everyday with this game i'm getting smarter at
sky's the limit so every time i get on the track
1996 i left it all behind
'cause i ain't got no roof on mine
i had to jump ship i double back for my chips
my captain handle my shit
i've never been the losing kind
grind i feel it like it's year one
i'm a fool anywhere near square one
but ain't no glass ceilings i crash through 'em

ain't no haters right just say congrats to him
this is detox it's rehab to 'em
i bring it back years later let it flow through 'em
putting that chronic in their systems like i used to do 'em
respected so it's proven that's what i've been doing
moving the game like weight and everybody been using
bitch it ain't really nothing left to say
you're tuned in to detox i am dr dre
your skin's your travelling bag of your existence
yours is shabby and scab while mine's glistenin'
vivid on my skin how many continents i visit then
you can journey with me to different places by listenin'
shitting on them your brother got it covered
we can slug it knuckle it however you want it i love it
a hustler's wit the grit the grind
my genetic code make up murderer by design
on mayan calendar time when night meets day
i'm in the light grey bugatti like a high speed chase
adrenaline like jogger the jumping rope in place
muhammed ali hobbies no pilates try'na keep the ocean by me
hit a rich man's wife see what these hoes can buy me
looking forward but it's nice to see the road behind me
hotel's a seven star baguette's glowing
keep your lid yet dawg the private jet boeing topless
holy toledo its angelina jolie amigo
she told me yo shady just hand your penis to me ill deep throat
and brad if you try to stand between us then were gonna see bro
who was a fantasy i dont mean to damage your ego
you faggots wanna 'rassle
i shove a fucking jar of vaseline up inside your asshole
and rope it shut with a lasso
couple of crushed lexapro broken up with the capsule or paxil
just in case i ain't dope enough with the raps though
coke is cut with tobacco smoke it up then go wacko
this is what happens when you mix a coconut with tabasco
shady let go the ho has been choked enough let her ass go
not till jessica simpson lets go of the tuna casserole
i used to love her hooters now carmen elektra's cuter
strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her
im off my fucking meds but im on an electric scooter
i might just scoot by and shoot my mom in the neck with rugers
spit in jason's face while i vomit on freddy kruegar
they cant even get jeffrey dahmer to pet the cougar
now im gone get the rectal thermometer get the lubra
cation and get the patient some darvocet to chew cause
i guess for him to stop is impossible
he just picked up another prostitute in the parking lot of the hospital
and beats her over the head mercilessly and left her for dead
he thought she was cause otherwise he would never have left
miraculously she survived the attack
even after his accuracy after he hacked the pussy with an ax
what other odds would she be back
he grabbed his encyclopedia off of the top of his fucking cd rack
hit her with that then he threw her into the tv ah
i'm not playing rihanna where'd you get the vd at
motherfuck the media
i'm reading ya something strictly from me to ya
straight off the paper and this one's a freebie jack
let me add my two cents
of course i side with chris brown
id beat a bitch down too
if she gave my dick an itch now
it's just ridiculous how
much this kind of sitowuation can make her stink
how much gangster shit can he dish out
oh my gosh i put natasha bedingfield in a washer
watch it go from rinse to spin cycle
it's like i got ya hypnotized and i forgot ya
my god ya psychologically fucked
michael would like an apology what
tell that psycho to stick a tyco truck and a white tricycle up his butt
and glue the seat of bicycle to his nuts
im as cold as a muthafucking icicle i'm a nut
i ain't nuttin nice man i like to pull knives and i like to cut
the poster addict for posttraumatic stress
i guess this is the most dramatic ive been in a while
this is the closest that it's come to the marshall mathers
i can hear him start to gather
i dont paint the portrait of the pictureperfect partridge family
this ain't your orphan annie no this is more uncanny
kick down dakota fanning's front door while the whore is tanning
he cant say whore of course he can man he just saw her fanny
then murdered her while he danced around the room and wore her panties
there's a certain mystique when i speak
that you notice that it's sorta unique
'cause you know it's me my poetry's deep
and i'm still matic the way i flow to this beat
you can't sit still it's like tryin' to smoke crack
and go to sleep i'm strapped
just knowing any minute i could snap
i'm the equivalent of what would happen if bush rapped
i bully these rappers so bad lyrically
it ain't even funny i ain't even hungry
it ain't even money you can't pay me enough
for you to play me it's cockamamie
you just ain't zany enough to rock with shady
my noodle is cockadoodle my clocks cuckoo
i got screws loose yeah the whole kittenkaboodle
i'm just brutal it's no rumor i'm numero uno assume it
there's no humor in it no more you know
i'm rollin' with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
you need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
i'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
i ain't never supposed to show it my crew ain't supposed to know it
even if it means goin' toe to toe with a benzino it don't matter
i'd never drag them in battles that i can handle unless i absolutely have to
i'm supposed to set an example
i need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide 'em
if some shit ever does pop off i'm supposed to be beside 'em
that ja shit i tried to squash it it was too late to stop it
theres a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
i heard him say hailie's name on a song and i just lost it
it was crazy this went way beyond some jayz and nas shit
and even though the battle was won i feel like we lost it
i spent too much energy on it honestly i'm exhausted
and i'm so caught in it i almost feel i'm the one who caused it
this ain't what i'm in hiphop for it's not why i got in it
i'm the man in my city ain't nobody wit me
you can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches
i'm a known drug dealer i always have 50's
and the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me
ss's on 26's watching some television
shorty i'm never slipping got the berretta in vision
and ready to pop the clip in ready to get to tripping
ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping
pimp stolen the automobile and the roof for the tag missing
polices try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given
addicted to fast living guess i'm one of my dad's children
think i'm bad now shoulda seen me before i had children
give dick to ya daddy's daughter and dare her to have children
hope he got some insurance 'cause death her is enduring
kill her in mississippi and drive her to missouri
still my wet paint drippin' while i'm woodgrain gripping
there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
and wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
but now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
the shit gets escalated it ain't just words no more is it
it's a different ball game you call names and you ain't just rappin'
we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happenin'
me and dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
and asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
until ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
fuck it 50 smash 'em mash on 'em let him have it
meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions
some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk
has an erection for me and thinks that i'll be his resurrection
tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
but now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways i came up
was through that publication the same one that made me famous
they keep on sayin' the same rappers are the best
jayz and kanye west maybe they're just tryna distract it
from the fact that i'm comin' back
or maybe it's 'cause i ain't black maybe it's because of that
maybe it's because i'm the highest sellin' artist in rap
while i'm sittin' back in my office jackin' off to my plaques
i'm still sick how can i be sick this long
and i'm still alive magic johnson of rhymes
i thrive on makin' my opponents think that i've died
that's when i just pop up outta nowhere oh yeah there we go there
damn i forgot how much money he got
on the beach of st tropez but your man don't lay
in the sun 'cause i don't tan i burn blood clot
when you gonna learn how much money we've earned
how does it feel to know i came in this game at 25
and coulda retired at 29 in my 20's still
and fif' hit a lick on that cocacola shit
he ain't even got to look at coke to even hold a brick
no more oh boy goddamn did he score
to go from sellin' bags to bottles right out the store
and shady hit the box office man he knocked the socks off us
my exwife is set for life you profitless cocksuckers
so stay the fuck off us we make pay
i'm just a super easy modest mc okay
till i hear the word has been that's when i start spazzin'
smart asses kiss a smarter ass then
i'm the best thing that ever happened to rap bastards
i'm a blonde dre now gimme kanye's glasses
yeah i talk the talk and i walk the walk
like a teflon don boy i run new york
when i come outta court yeah i pop the cork
i keep it gangsta i have ya outlined in chalk
in the hood if ya ask about me
they'll tell ya i'm about my bread
round the world if ya ask about me
they'll tell ya they love the kid
i cut back on the syllables just a little but still i feel i should
killafew just toshow that still i do putforth an effort
one foot forward thank heavens and good lord
whoever would've thought that my umbilical cord
would've been ccutcut from the sssame cloth
there's no other name just be thankful that i came forth
temper the same whether it's boiled or flame broiled
you say my name you bet that ass you gon' pay for it
just the respect is not the crown that i came for
but if you feel like passin' it around well then jay throw it
'cause we all go straight toward it if not i just wait for it
the other skateboard got a couple of scrapes forget about it
i'm stuck in this rut but i'll get up out it
i always do i ain't gon' sit here and argue about it
i can't hop out of that gutter i just crawl through up out it
i'm back i'm sorry i feel awful about it
i still remember the hip hop shop days
all i ever wanted was to get propsnotpraise
a couple eyebrowsjust to send shockshockwaves
through the undergroundbbbut not like this
this is when the shit ggggot got crazy
i was in the studio with the doc doc drezy
that's all i remember 'fore the shit got got hazy
then we made a song called mmmy name is yeah
and it skipped right over hiphop into hiphop stations
top 40 on radio the kid got famous woo
he made it but this was jjjust not the way this
was supposed to go i'm afraid to say this but
transition to it's been real
it's like our legacy's pregnant we're planting eggs every record
they're beggin' me to release a cd every other second
but don't xpect it 'cause evry time i get hit with that question
i just deflect it get cahis or 50's record and check it
and buck is out like get these motherfuckers out 'fore i smack 'em
plus ti just dropped an album now go out and get that one
and i got a whole stable of artists who's able and fully capable
of holdin' a label 'til i figure out when i'm ready to drop
or maybe not shady look how hot you were on top
you were pop you were so popular now you're not
you're a washed up entrepreneur how's it possible
well it's not if your little fickle minds would've caught on but you didn't
see i don't rap for the green i mean i ain't greedy
but i also know what it's like to be needy and i will never
go back to poverty see it ain't easy to try to step
away from entertainment separate it from cds
and every day it just seems like we're beefin' even the media's
meat eaters they gotta give you something to read
or you won't buy it believe what you wanna believe
let 'em feed to you the bs ps peace to ti
you gon be 'aight and we out
